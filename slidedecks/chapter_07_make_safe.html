                <h4>Answer Key (Discussion Break #2)</h4>
                <p><strong>Share Good Intent:</strong> Start by making your positive intentions explicit. Don&#39;t assume people know your motives.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Apologize:</strong> Requires a genuine change of heart&mdash;giving up saving face or being right to focus on what you really want.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Contrast:</strong> A don&#39;t/do statement. Address fears first (don&#39;t), then clarify real intent (do). Works even better as prevention than repair.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong><span class="term" data-def="CRIB: Commit to seek mutual purpose, Recognize the purpose behind the strategy, Invent a mutual purpose, Brainstorm new strategies">CRIB</span>:</strong> For true cross-purposes. Most arguments are about strategies, not purposes. Ask WHY to find the purpose behind the demand&mdash;then brainstorm strategies that serve both purposes.</p>
