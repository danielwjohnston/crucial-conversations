    <article>
        <p>In Chapter Seven, make it safe. How to make it safe? To talk about almost anything. A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in baskets of silver. Proverbs, 2511, the last chapter contained a promise, if you spot safety risks as they happen, you can step out of the conversation build safety, and then find a way to talk about just about anything with just about anyone in this chapter, we'll fulfill that promise by teaching what it takes to create and restore safety to get started, let's eavesdrop on a crucial conversation between a couple named Oba and Mari. Oba is a chef and Mari is a project manager for a global supply chain company. The last year has been hard. A recession triggered a restructuring in Mari S company, and she was asked to take on additional responsibilities while downsizing her team. Worse, the restaurant OPA worked for closed and he hasn't found another steady job. The financial strain of losing opa's income, compounded by the longer hours Mari is working, has put an incredible amount of pressure on the relationship. Opa feels that Mari doesn't have time for him or their relationship, that he is always coming second to work. Mari is feeling burned out from work and doesn't think OPA has picked up enough of their home responsibilities. For months, the two have been acting out their concerns rather than talking them out. When Mari works late, Oba feels rejected and pouts sitting at home and watching television. Mari comes home sees Oba sitting on the couch while the laundry still isn't done and dishes are piled in the sink.</p>
        <p>She gets angry, makes a snide remark, which makes Oba feel even more resentful, Mari retreats to their room, collapses exhausted, onto the bed, and Oba eventually falls asleep on the couch. After months of this, Oba decides to broach the topic with Mari, rather than waiting to talk when they're both tired or upset. He picks a rare Sunday morning when they're having a relaxing brunch. Oba, Mari, I was wondering if we could talk about what happened on Friday night, you know, when you got home late from work and went straight to our room. Mari, Oh, you mean Friday night when you were sitting on the couch rather than doing chores in the house that Friday night? Oba, hey, I was waiting for you to get home so we could spend some time together. Mari, sure you were waiting for me. All right, waiting for me to do everything around here that needs to be done. When are you going to start carrying your share of the load around here? Oba, walks out. Step out. Make it safe, then step back in. Okay, let's look at Oba. He tried to tackle a tough topic, good for him. That wasn't easy after months of not saying anything, but he dove in anyway, and then his partner responded in a snarky way. Now, what should he do? How can he get back to honest and healthy dialog? What do you do when you don't feel safe sharing what's on your mind? The key is to step out of the content of the conversation. That's right.</p>
        <p>When safety is at risk and you notice people moving to silence or violence, or violence, you need to step out of the content of the conversation, literally, stop talking about the topic of your conversation, and rebuild safety. How do you do that? You first need to understand why someone feels unsafe. People never become defensive about what you're saying, the content of your message, they become defensive because of why they think you're saying it the intent Said another way safety in a conversation is about intent, not content. When people become defensive, it is because either one you have a bad intent toward them, and they are accurately picking up on that or two, they have misunderstood your good intent. If it's the former, you need to go back and start with heart. Remember it's easy for our motives to degrade in a crucial conversation. Check yourself by asking, What am I acting like? I want. This question helps us see ourselves as other people are seeing us. Then ask yourself, what do I really want for you, for them, for the relationship? If your motives have degraded, step back and refocus on what it is you really want. You. Now, often the problem is not that we have bad intent, it's that our intent has been misunderstood. Remember, human beings are wired to look for threats. When people feel threatened, they move to silence or verbal violence or to fight or flight, none of which are great for problem solving. All you need to do to destroy safety in a Crucial Conversation is nothing during these tense seconds at the beginning of a conversation, others are scanning your every facial tic or leg crossing for evidence of your intentions. Do you mean them harm?</p>
        <p>Are you out to get them? Your job is to generate evidence that that's not the case. Take a moment to absorb that last sentence. It's not enough for you to have good intentions. The other person must know that this is the case. Think about this in the context of unconscious bias, the discomforts and judgments that we have about those who are different from us and that we are unaware. We carry these biases will cause you to communicate subtle signals to others that make them feel unsafe, breaking eye contact, stepping back a bit, frowning almost imperceptibly. Similarly, they may carry unconscious biases toward you that make them feel less safe. This is one more reason to take on the task of generating clear and unmistakable evidence for them to the contrary. In this case, Oba genuinely wanted to talk with Mari about their relationship. He loves her, and he knows that the way they've been treating each other isn't good for either of them. He wants to improve their relationship for both of them, so he speaks up, and Mari gets defensive. Why? Because she jumped to a conclusion about oba's intent. Oba didn't provide any evidence at the outset of his intent, and so Mari probably, and predictably, thought he was attacking her for the umpteenth time about the long hours she was working and how she never had time for him before he even finished his first sentence, she was on the defensive, and she attacked back. In these circumstances, the worst at dialog, do what Oba and Mari did. Like Mari, they say whatever is on their minds with no regard for how it will be received.</p>
        <p>Or like Oba, they conclude the topic is completely unsafe and move to silence those who are good at dialog realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way. They try to make the subject more palatable by sugar coating their message. Oh, honey, I know you wanted to spend time together, but I was just so tired on Friday, they tried to make things safer by watering down or dressing up their content. This strategy, of course, avoids the real problem and it never gets fixed. The best at dialog don't play games period. They know that in order to solve their problem, they'll need to talk about their problem with no pretending, sugar, quoting or faking. So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation. Make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything. Two conditions of safety. In order for people to feel safe with you, they need to know two things about your intent, they need to know that you care about their concerns, mutual purpose and you care about them mutual respect. We call mutual purpose and mutual respect, the conditions of dialog. Only when these two conditions are met, when there is mutual purpose and mutual respect, will you have the safety needed for meaning to flow into the pool? Let's look at each of these conditions in turn, mutual purpose, the entrance condition. Remember the last time someone gave you difficult feedback and you didn't become defensive? Say a friend said some things to you that most people might get upset over.</p>
        <p>In order for this person to be able to deliver the delicate message, you must have believed he or she cared about you or about your goals and objectives. That means you trusted his or her purposes so you were willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. This is the first condition of safety mutual purpose. Mutual purpose means that others perceive that you're working toward a common outcome in the conversation, that you care about their goals, interests and values and vice versa, you believe they care about yours. Come. Consequently, mutual purpose is the entry condition of dialog. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking. For example, if Mari believes that opa's purpose in raising this delicate topic is to make her feel guilty or to get his way, the conversation is doomed from the outset. If she believes he really cares about making things better for both of them, he may have a chance a sure fire mutual purpose. Sometimes it seems impossible to find a mutual purpose. You can't imagine any goal or purpose you and the other person could possibly have in common. After all, just think about whom he voted for in the last election. You'll never agree with this guy about anything, but there is one way to always find mutual purpose in the conversation. You see, human beings have an innate need to be heard. We want to be listened to and understood. So a great mutual purpose to start with is to seek mutual understanding. If the other person truly believes you sincerely want to understand his or her needs or point of view, you have the basic makings of safety.</p>
        <p>And once the other person feels deeply understood, he or she is more likely to have the psychological resources to listen to you. Remember the mutual in mutual purpose, there's a lot you can do in a conversation to create safety through mutual purpose. Later in this chapter, we'll lay out the specific steps you can take to create a mutual purpose when you find yourselves at cross purposes. But don't mistake your responsibility to create safety in the dialog as meaning you should not expect the other person to acknowledge your needs mutual purpose must be mutual. Yes, you need to care about the other person's purpose, but the other person also needs to care about your purpose. You don't need to subordinate your purpose to that of others, just to create a veneer of safety for them. So what do you do if the other person doesn't seem to care about your purpose? You choose that as the topic of the crucial conversation you need to have. After all, your purpose is every bit as important as the other person's, and you could and should hold that as a boundary. For example, you might say it's important to me that we have a collaborative and productive relationship. I'd like to talk about a pattern I've noticed in our conversations. I know we often have different goals or objectives, and I hope you know that I care about your objectives as well as my own. Sometimes, though, I sense that you don't really care about my goals, and that can make it tough for me to talk about things with you. I'm wondering if I've misread this look for mutuality.</p>
        <p>Let's see how mutual purpose applies to a tough example, one where at first glance, it might appear as if your purpose is to make things better for yourself. Let's say you've got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don't trust him? Surely, there's no way to say this without him becoming defensive, right? Not necessarily to avoid disaster. Find a mutual purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he'd want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get what you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish, which is what you are. In contrast, if you try to see the other person's point of view, you can often find a way to draw the person willingly into even very sensitive conversations. For example, if the boss's behavior is causing you to miss deadlines he cares about, or incur costs he frets over, or lose productivity he worries about, then you're onto a possible mutual purpose. Imagine raising the topic this way. I've got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few $1,000 in preparing the report each month. It's going to be a bit of a sense of conversation, but I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it now. You've got a mutual purpose, mutual respect, the continuance condition. While it's true that there's no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don't have mutual purpose, it's equally true that you can't stay in the conversation if you don't maintain mutual respect.</p>
        <p>Mutual respect is the continuance condition of dialog as people perceive that others don't respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe, and dialog comes to a screeching halt. Why? Because respect is like air. As long as it's present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it's all that people can think about, the instant people perceive. Disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose. It's now about defending dignity. For example, you're talking with a group of supervisors about a complicated quality problem. You really want to see the problem resolved once and for all. Your job depends on it. Unfortunately, you also think the supervisors are overpaid and under qualified. You firmly believe that not only are they in over their heads, but they do stupid things all the time. Some of them even act unethically as the supervisors throw out ideas you roll your eyes the disrespect you carry in your head creeps out in one unfortunate gesture, and now it's all over without mutual respect. The conversation tanks. The supervisors take shots at your proposals you add insulting adjectives in describing theirs as attention turns to scoring points, everyone loses your mutual purpose suffers from a lack of mutual respect. Telltale signs to spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity. Emotions are the key. When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger, then they resort to pouting, name calling, yelling and making threats to determine when mutual respect is at risk, ask yourself, do others believe I respect them?</p>
        <p>Can you respect people you don't respect some people fear they'll never be able to maintain mutual respect with certain individuals, or in certain circumstances, how they wonder, can I respect someone who behaves in ways I deplore? What do you do? For example, if you're upset because another person has let you down, and if this has happened repeatedly, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish? Dialog truly would be doomed if we had to respect every element of another person's character before we could talk if this were the case, the only person we'd be able to talk to would be ourselves however, we can stay in dialog by finding a way to honor and regard another person's basic humanity. In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves. We can counteract these feelings by looking for the ways we are similar without excusing others' behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize with them. A rather clever person once hinted how to do this in the form of a prayer, Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I? When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it's easier to find a way to respect others. When we do this, we feel a kinship between ourselves and even the thorniest of people. This connection to others helps create mutual respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialog with virtually anyone. Consider the following true example, workers at a manufacturing company had been out on strike for over six months. Finally, the union agreed to return to work, but the represented employees had to sign a contract that was worse than what they were originally demanding.</p>
        <p>On the first day back, it was clear that although people would work, they wouldn't do so with a smile and a spring in their step. Everyone was furious. How are people ever going to move ahead? Concerned that although the strike was over, the battle wasn't a manager asked one of the authors to lend a hand. The author met with two groups of leaders, both managers and union heads and asked them to do one thing, each group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on a flip chart sized paper. For two hours, each group feverishly laid out what it wanted in the future and then taped the list to the wall. When they finished their assignment, the groups were asked to swap places with the goal of finding something, anything they might have in common. After a few minutes, the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn't merely share the shadow of an idea or two, their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high quality products and a positive impact on the community, given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person. Wanted this experience caused members from each group to seriously question how they had judged the other side. They began to see others as more similar to themselves. They realized the petty and political tactics that others had used were embarrassingly similar to the ones they themselves had employed.</p>
        <p>The sins of others were different from their own more because of the role they played than because of a fundamental blight on their character. They restored mutual respect and dialog replaced silence and violence for the first time in decades, build and rebuild safety. We know we need to have both mutual purpose and mutual respect in order to have an effective dialog. We've also argued that you should be able to find a way to both find mutual purpose and enjoy mutual respect, even with people who are flawed or different. But how what are you supposed to actually do? Here are four skills that the best at dialog routinely used to build safety up front in a conversation and rebuild safety when it's been lost. Number one, share your good intent. Number two, apologize when appropriate. Number three, contrast, to fix misunderstandings. Number four, create a mutual purpose. Share your good intent, as we have discussed, if people aren't sure of your intent, they will assume the worst. We saw this with Oba and Mari. Oba opened the conversation with a seemingly innocuous statement, Mari, I was wondering if we could talk about what happened on Friday night. You know, when you got home late from work and went straight to our room, he asked to talk and related the facts and what happened. Mari immediately got defensive. Why? Because she assumed Oba was bringing up this topic so that he could criticize her for her behavior, and why wouldn't she when that's how he framed the conversation. He set the whole thing up as let's talk about you going straight into our room. It's no surprise that Mari felt unsafe, but let's step back for a moment.</p>
        <p>If we asked Oba, what do you really want here, he would say, I want a better relationship with Mari. I want to be honest with her about how I feel, and I want her to be honest with me. I want us to be gentle with each other as we talk about tough things. So imagine if Oba started the conversation with that. Oba Mari, I was wondering if we could talk about what happened on Friday night. I love you, and I want to make sure we're talking about things that impact our relationship, because our relationship is the most important thing in the world to me. I'm sure there are things you'd like me to change, and I want to understand those as well as share concerns I have. Could we talk? When you start the conversation by sharing your good intent, you lay the foundation for safety. It doesn't mean that the other person won't get defensive as the conversation progresses, but it does give you the touchstone you need to return to again and again when safety is at risk. Apologize when appropriate, when you've made a mistake that has hurt others, start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing, or at least not preventing pain or difficulty to others. For example, the division vice president is coming to your plant for a tour. Part of the tour includes a visit with the members of the quality team who have recently put some new process improvements in place. The team members are excited and have worked all night preparing for the VIP tour. Unfortunately, when it comes time to swing by their area, the visiting VP drops a bomb.</p>
        <p>He lays out a new production plan that you're convinced will hurt quality and potentially drive away your biggest customers. Since you only have another hour with the VP, you choose to talk through the issue rather than conduct the tour. Your future depends upon this particular conversation. Fortunately, you and the VP are able to come to agreement on a new plan. Unfortunately, you forgot to get word to the team that had worked so hard as you walk back to your office after escorting the executive to her car, you bump into the team bleary eyed and disappointed, all six team members are fuming, no visit, no phone call, and now it's clear from the way you were sprinting past them that you weren't even going to stop and offer a simple explanation. Question, ouch. Things start turning ugly. We pulled an all nighter, and you didn't even bother to come by, not even a text message to tell us something came up. Thanks a lot. Time stands still. This conversation has just turned crucial. The employees who worked so hard are obviously upset. They feel disrespected, despite the fact that you weren't trying to be disrespectful, but you failed to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They've attacked you so you stay stuck in the content of the conversation, thinking this has something to do with the factory tour. I had to choose between the future of the company and a facility tour. I chose our future, and I'd do it again if I had to. Now both you and they are fighting for respect. This is getting you nowhere fast.</p>
        <p>But what else can you do instead of getting hooked and fighting back, break the cycle, see their aggressive behavior for what it is, a sign of violated safety, then step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by restoring respect. It's time to apologize sincerely for being disrespectful. I'm sorry I didn't give you a call when I learned that we wouldn't be coming by. You worked all night. It would have been a wonderful chance to showcase your improvements, and I didn't even explain to you what happened. I apologize. Now an apology isn't really an apology, unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face being right or winning in order to focus on what you really want, you have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you are rewarded with something even more valuable, healthy dialog and better results. Contrast fixed misunderstandings. Sometimes others feel disrespected during Crucial Conversations, even though you haven't done anything disrespectful. Sure, there are times when respect gets violated because you behave in clearly hurtful ways, but just as often, the insult is entirely unintended. The same can happen with mutual purpose. You can start by innocently sharing your views, but other people believe your intention is to harm them or coerce them into accepting your opinion. Clearly, an apology is not appropriate in these circumstances. It would be disingenuous to admit that you were wrong when you weren't. How then can you rebuild mutual purpose or mutual respect in order to make it safe to get back to dialog when others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent.</p>
        <p>Step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called contrasting. Contrasting is a don't do statement that fixes misunderstandings in the don't part of the statement. You explain what you don't intend for the conversation. This addresses others concerns that you don't respect them or that you have a malicious purpose in the do part of the statement, you clarify what your intention for the conversation really is. This confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose. For example, with Oba and Mari. Mari defensively, why are you always on my case? I'm working as hard as I can and carrying this huge load while you watch TV. Oba, using contrasting to restore purpose. I don't want to criticize you or get on your case. That wasn't my intent, and I know you're carrying a huge load. I do want us to be able to talk about our concerns with each other, so we can address them and build our relationship or with you and the quality team after the VPS non visit team defensively, you totally ignored us and the work we've done to make this plant run you. Using contrasting to restore respect. The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don't value the work you put in, or that I don't want to share it with the VP. I think your work has been nothing short of amazing, and I am committed to making sure the VP knows that of the two parts of contrasting the don't is the more important, because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.</p>
        <p>The employees who worked so hard are acting on the belief that you don't appreciate their efforts and didn't care enough to keep them informed when the exact. The opposite was true. When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop use contrasting. Explain what you don't mean, until you've restored safety, then return to the conversation. Safety first, once you've done this and safety returns to the conversation, then you can explain what you do intend Safety First, use contrasting to provide context and proportion. When you're in the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others experience your words as bigger or worse than you intend. For example, you talk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality, when you share your concern, he appears crushed. At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content. You know it's really not that big a deal. Don't give in to the temptation. Don't take back what you've said and don't apologize for it. Instead, put your remarks in context. For instance, at this point, your assistant may believe you are completely dissatisfied with his performance. He believes that your view of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect for him. If this belief is incorrect, use contrasting to clarify what you don't and do believe. Start with what you don't believe. Let me put this in perspective. I don't want you to think I'm not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you're doing a good job. Then add what you do. Believe this punctuality issue is important to me, and I'd just like to work on that if you'll be more attentive to that there are no other issues.</p>
        <p>Use contrasting for prevention. So far, we've shown how contrasting can be used as first aid for a wounded conversation, someone has taken something wrong, and we've intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning, however contrasting, can also be a powerful tool for preventing safety problems. In this respect, it's similar to starting a conversation by sharing your good intent. Two examples I wanted to talk about how we're managing our finances. I don't want you to think that I don't appreciate the time you've taken to keep our checking account balanced and up to date. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldn't have done nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns with how we're using the new online banking system. I'd like to talk to you about something that's worrying me, and I'm honestly not sure how to handle this conversation. My fear is that I'll draw down on our relationship, and that's not my intent at all. It's the opposite. My goal in bringing this up is to strengthen our relationship, contrasting for prevention of safety problems, works well when you have some experience with the other person and have a good guess based on that experience of how the person may misunderstand your intent create mutual purpose. Sometimes we find ourselves in the middle of a debate because we clearly have different purposes. There is no misunderstanding here. Contrasting won't do the trick. We need something sturdier for this job. For instance, you've just been offered a promotion that will help propel your career along a faster track and bring you a great deal more authority, and it pays enough to help soften the blow of displacement.</p>
        <p>The last part is important, because you'll have to move the family across the country, and your spouse and kids love where you currently live. You expected your spouse to have feelings of ambivalence over the move, but he or she doesn't seem to be ambivalent even a tiny bit to your spouse. The promotion is a bad news bad news event. First, you have to move and second, you'll work even longer hours. That whole thing about the more money and power doesn't seem to be compensating for the loss of time together. Now what the worst at dialog? Either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation. The good at dialog move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two households, one where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it's a pretty ugly solution that's bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce in. While compromise is sometimes necessary, the best know better than to start there. The best at dialog use four skills to create a mutual purpose, if it helps you remember what to do. Note that the four skills used in creating mutual purpose form the acronym crib, commit to seek mutual purpose, as with most dialog skills, if we want to get back to dialog, we have to start with heart. In this case, we have to agree to agree to be successful. We have to stop using silence or violence to compel others to our view.</p>
        <p>We must even surrender false dialog where we pretend to have a mutual purpose, calmly arguing our side until the other person gives in. We start with heart by committing to stay in the conversation until we invent a solution that serves a purpose we both share. This can be tough to stop arguing. We have to suspend our belief that our choice is the absolute best and only one, and that we'll never be happy until we get exactly what we currently want. We have to open our mind to the fact that maybe, just maybe, there is a third choice out there, one that suits everyone. We also have to be willing to verbalize this commitment, even when our partner seems committed to winning, we act on faith that our partner is stuck in silence or violence because he or she feels unsafe. We assume that if we build more safety by demonstrating our commitment to finding a mutual purpose, the other person will feel more confident that dialog could be a productive Avenue. So next time you find yourself stuck in a battle of wills, try this amazingly powerful but simple skill. Step out of the content of the struggle and make it safe. Simply say it seems like we're both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfies both of us. Then watch whether safety takes a turn for the better. Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Wanting to come up with a shared goal is a wonderful first step, but desire alone is not enough. After we've experienced a change of heart, we need to change our strategy as well. Here's the problem we have to fix.</p>
        <p>When we find ourselves at an impasse, it's because we're asking for one thing and the other person is asking for something else. We think we'll never find a way out, because we equate what we're asking for with what we actually want. In truth, what we're asking for is the strategy we're suggesting to get what we want. We confuse wants or purpose with strategy. That's the problem. For example, I come home from work and say that I want to go to a movie. You say that you want to stay home and relax. And so we debate, movie, TV, movie, read, we figure we'll never be able to resolve our differences, because going out and staying home are incompatible. In such circumstances, we can break the impasse by asking others, what do you want in this situation? It might go like this. Why do you want to stay home? Because I'm tired of running around and dealing with the hassle of the city. Ah, so you want peace and quiet, mostly. And why do you want to go to a movie so I can spend some time with you, away from the kids? Before you can agree on a mutual purpose, you must first know what people's real purposes are. Step out of the content of the conversation, which is generally focused on strategies, and explore the purposes behind them. When you do separate strategies from purpose, new options become possible. By releasing your grip on your strategy and focusing on your real purpose, you're now open to the idea that you might actually find alternatives that can serve both your interests. You want peace and quiet, and I want time with you, away from the kids.</p>
        <p>So if we can come up with something that is quiet and away, we'll both be happy. Is that right? Absolutely. What if we were to take a drive up the canyon and invent a mutual purpose? Sometimes, when you recognize the purposes behind another person's strategies, you discover that you actually have compatible goals. From there, you simply come up with common strategies. But you're not always so lucky. For example, you find out that your genuine wants and goals cannot be served except at the expense of the other persons. In this case, you cannot discover a mutual purpose. That means you'll have to actively invent one to invent a mutual purpose. Move to more encompassing goals, find an objective that is more meaningful or more rewarding than the one that divides the various sides. For instance, you and your spouse may not agree on whether or not you should take the promotion, but you can agree that the needs of your relationship and the children come before career aspirations by focusing on higher and longer term goals, you often find ways to transcend short term compromises, build mutual purpose and return to dialog. Brainstorm news strategies. Once you've built safety by finding a shared purpose, you should have enough safety to return to the content of the conversation. It's time to step back into the dialog and brainstorm strategies that meet everyone's needs. If you've committed to finding something everyone can support and you've surfaced what you really want, you'll no longer be spending your energy on unproductive conflict. Instead, you'll be actively coming up with options that can serve everyone, suspend judgment and think outside the box for new alternatives.</p>
        <p>Can you find a way to work in a job that is local and still meets your career goals? Is this job with this company, the only thing that will make you happy is a move really necessary in this new job, is there another community that could offer your family the same benefits? If you're not willing to give creativity a try, it will be impossible for you to jointly come up with a mutually acceptable option. On the other hand, if you are able to, the sky is the limit, create a mutual purpose. In summary, when you sense that you and others are working at cross purposes, here's what you can do. First step out of the content of the conflict, stop focusing on who thinks what. Then create a mutual purpose with these four steps. Number one, commit to seek a mutual purpose. Make a unilateral public commitment to stay in the conversation until you come up with something that serves everyone. It sounds like this isn't working. Your team is arguing to stay late and work until we're done, and my team wants to go home and come back on the weekend. Why don't we see if we can come up with something that satisfies everyone. Number two, recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Ask people why they want what they're pushing for, separate what they're demanding from the purpose it serves. It sounds like exactly why don't you want to come in on Saturday morning. Well, we're feeling fatigued and are worried about safety issues and a loss of quality. Why do you want to stay late? Number three, invent a mutual purpose. If after clarifying everyone's purposes, you're still at odds.</p>
        <p>See if you can invent a higher or longer term purpose that's more motivating than the ones that keep you in conflict. It sounds like I certainly don't want to make winners and losers here. It's far better if we can come up with something that doesn't make one team resent the other. We voted before or flipped a coin and the losers just end up resenting the winners. I'm more worried about how we feel about each other than anything else. Let's make sure that whatever we do, we don't drive a wedge into our working relationship. Number four, brainstorm new strategies with a clear mutual purpose. You can join forces in searching for a solution that serves everyone. It sounds like so we need to come up with something that doesn't jeopardize safety and quality and allows your team to attend your colleague's wedding on Saturday afternoon. My team members have a game on Saturday morning. What if your team were to work the morning and early afternoon, and then our team can come in after the game and take over from there, that way we'll be able to write it twice. Thus far, we've been sharing examples of how to create or restore safety in a conversation that's happening face to face, in person or online, or at the very least on the phone. But what about safety in written communication like email or text. Well, hold on to your seats for this one, because it turns out that you create safety in written communication the same way you do in face to face conversation.</p>
        <p>Yep, if you are emailing another human being and want to create safety for the person, the key is to remember that you are emailing another human being, and then create safety by sharing your good intent, because that's what makes it safe for human beings. Revolutionary. We know the core conditions of safety don't change based on the medium. If I know you care about me, mutual respect, and I know you care about what I care about, mutual purpose, I'll feel safe with you, whether conversing face to face or reading an email. The key difference in email and other written communication is that it is even more essential to verbalize your good intent in face to face conversations, we share our intent with both words, we apologize, contrast, etc, and non verbals, our tone of voice, our body language, eye contact, etc. When visual cues are removed, it becomes even more essential to use our words to communicate our intent problematically at the moment that it's most important to remember, we forget that we're communicating with a human being who needs to feel safe. After all, no one else is around. It's just us and our keyboard and we are typing away. So here's a tip for making sure you communicate intent when typing a crucial message to someone, write it twice. First write the message to get your content across. Once you have your content down, consider how your intent is coming across, read the message slowly imagining the other person's face, how might the person feel at each point in your message, then rewrite it with safety in mind.</p>
        <p>NOTICE places someone may misunderstand your intentions or your respect and clarify what you do and don't intend for them to hear in less formal, more personal relationships. You may even want to describe the facial expression you're wearing as you write something, just to make your intent even clearer. For example, if you could see my face right now as I write this, you'd probably see the wrinkles in my worried forehead as I hope that my message isn't coming across as harsh or critical we tend to think of asynchronous written communication as a distant second best when it comes to having crucial conversations, and in most ways It is, however, there is one advantage to asynchronous communication, if you are savvy enough to use it with virtual communication like email, You get your second chance before you need it, before you even messed up. Rather than saying something and then thinking, I could have said that better, you get to write something and then re read it before you ever send it. We have to learn the discipline of taking that second chance to build safety before we need it. How do I have a crucial conversation?

Let's end the chapter where we started. Oba is going to try to move to dialog with Mari. Let's see how he does at making it safe in this crucial conversation, because they have tried to have this conversation before and failed.</p>
        <p>He has a good idea of how Mari might misunderstand his intent, so he'll start by sharing his good intent with a contrasting statement. Oba, Mari, I'd like to talk about how much you're working and how it's impacting our relationship. I'm not bringing this up to criticize you or suggest the problem is yours. I know you're under tremendous pressure at work right now, and I am so grateful for the sacrifices you're making for our family. I really just want to talk about what we can do to make things better for both of us in this new reality we're in. Mari, what's there to talk about? I work you don't I'm trying to accept that. Oba, I think it's more complicated than that. And when you say things like that, it makes me wonder if you respect me anymore. Mari, if that's how you feel, why are we pretending to have a relationship at all. Okay, what just happened? Remember, we're exploring oba's side of the conversation. He's the one initiating the talk. Clearly, there's a lot Mari could be doing to make things go better, but what should Oba do if he wants the conversation to go better? He should stay focused on what he really wants to find a way to make things better for both of them. Consequently, he shouldn't respond to the content of Mari s discouraging statement. Rather, he should look at the safety issue behind it. Why is Mari starting to withdraw from the conversation? Two reasons. One. One, the way Oba made his point, sounded to her like he was blaming her for everything. And two, she believes his concern in one small area reflects his total feelings toward her, so he'll apologize using contrasting to rebuild safety.</p>
        <p>Oba, I'm sorry I said it that way. I'm not blaming you for how I feel or act. That's my problem. I don't see this as your problem. I see it as our problem. Both of us may be acting in ways that make things worse. I know I am at least Mari. I probably am too sometimes I pout because I'm just so overwhelmed and burned out, and I also do it hoping it'll make you feel bad. I'm sorry about that too. Notice what just happened. Since Oba dealt well with the safety issue and kept focused on what he really wanted out of this conversation, Mari returned to the conversation. This is far more effective than if Oba had gone into blaming let's continue, Mari. I just don't see how we can work this out. My job is what it is right now, with you out of work, I'm not really in a position to cut back or try to renegotiate, and when I come home and see all the housework that hasn't been done, it's just really frustrating. I know you want us to spend more time together, but I'm exhausted and need time on my own to recharge. The problem now is one of mutual purpose. Mari thinks she and Oba are at cross purposes. In her mind, there is no possibility of a mutually satisfactory solution she only has 24 hours in the day. Rather than move to compromise or fight for his way, Oba will step out of the issue and use crib to get to mutual purpose. Oba, commit to seek mutual purpose. I know you're stretched thin and I don't want something that doesn't work for you.</p>
        <p>I want to find a way to have us both feel close, appreciated and loved. Mari, that's what I want, too. It just seems like there's not enough time in the day for that. Oba, recognize the purpose behind the strategy, maybe, but maybe not. What would make you feel loved and appreciated in our relationship? Mari, well, it's hard to say this, because I don't want to hurt you, and I know this is sensitive. I know you feel bad about being out of work, and I get that, but you are out of work right now, and it would really helped me feel better about our relationship if you started to take on more of the work at home, like the dishes and laundry and stuff. When we were both working, we divided that 5050 but we're not both working now. Oba, Okay, that's fair, and I'm glad you said that I have struggled with a lot of self doubt, and it has really impacted my motivation. I think that's one of the reasons that now, maybe more than ever, I'm really craving time with you, just fun time where we can talk and laugh and enjoy each other's company, Mari, I get that, but it's hard to enjoy anything when I'm so burned out and then I resent you for the pressure I feel. Ohba, yep, I hear that, and I feel that resentment, which just makes me feel even worse about myself, because I know I'm letting you down, Mari, invent a mutual purpose. So we need to find some ways to get some of the load off my shoulders so that we can enjoy each other more. I really want that too. You know, Oba, I know you do.</p>
        <p>I don't imagine either of us likes feeling this way. Mari brainstorm new strategies. Well, what if we, Oba and Mari haven't solved their problem yet, and there are a lot of real world constraints that will make it difficult. However, they are far more likely to solve their problem and build their relationship than they were at the beginning of this chapter. Creating safety doesn't resolve all our issues. It simply creates the space to give dialog a chance. My Crucial Conversation, Dr Jerry M on a Monday, a woman was admitted to my hospital for same day vascular bypass surgery to repair a painful extremity below the knee that wasn't adequately circulating blood. She lived in Mississippi and had traveled two hours to Memphis to see a doctor. The surgeon skillfully performed the procedure, and the outcome was excellent. The next day, the patient and her husband were deliriously happy because the terrible pain in her foot was gone, the case manager and physician had tentatively agreed that if everything was fine, the patient could be discharged Thursday afternoon. As the patient continued to improve, the case manager made arrangements for a Thursday discharge. On Thursday morning, the case manager told the patient's husband to come and pick up his wife, unaware that the doctor had written the following note. Patient, doing fine. Foot, warm. Pulse, excellent. Patient, stable. Plan, discharge. Friday. Am seeing in the note, the case manager attempted to reach the surgeon, and finally contacted him late that afternoon, as he frantically rushed his office, running late, the surgeon bluntly said, I need to see this patient before discharge. I won't be in until tomorrow. The patient is not going home today, and that's that. Around 3pm the case manager contacted me for help.</p>
        <p>I immediately called the surgeon and began our conversation by praising his success and offering my assistance. I explained that the patient's family had driven two hours to pick her up and she was ready to go. I offered to do the paperwork while he gave instructions to the couple over the phone, but he persisted. No, I need to see this patient, and I can't be in until tomorrow. And then defensively, he raised his voice, is the insurance company putting you up to this? I mean, why are you pressuring me? Taken aback, I responded by using the contrasting skill, honestly, I don't even know who the payer is. This isn't about the insurance company. This is about meeting the needs of the patient and the family. They've had a wonderful experience. They think you walk on water. They were told they could go home. And I'm afraid canceling the discharge could Sully an otherwise wonderful clinical outcome. Floundering a bit. The surgeon responded. Tell them, I'll be in, but it won't be until seven, reaching agreement, I promised to communicate his willingness to make a special trip back and personally give instructions. He came in that night, discharged the patient and avoided tarnishing an otherwise excellent episode of care in the healthcare environment. Crucial Conversations are real. They're up front, and they happen all the time. This conversation was successful because I followed two of the quintessential rules, mutual respect and mutual purpose. Summary, make it safe. Step out of the content when others move to silence or violence. Step out of the content of the conversation. And make it safe when safety is restored, go back to the issue at hand and continue the dialog. Decide which condition of safety is at risk. Mutual purpose.</p>
        <p>Do others believe you care about their goals in the conversation? Do they trust your motives or mutual respect? Do others believe you respect them. Share your good intent. To start the conversation off right, share your positive intent. What do you really want for you and the other person? Apologize when appropriate, when you've clearly violated respect. Apologize, contrast, to fix misunderstanding when others misunderstand either your purpose or your intent, use contrasting start with what you don't intend or mean, then explain what you do intend or mean. Create a mutual purpose when you are at cross purposes, use the four crib skills to get back to mutual purpose. Commit to seek mutual purpose. Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Invent a mutual purpose. Brainstorm new strategies.</p>
