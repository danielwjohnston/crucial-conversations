                <h4>Answer Key (Discussion Break #1)</h4>
                <p><strong>Who makes us angry?</strong> We make ourselves angry. Others don't create our emotions&mdash;we do. Our emotions come from the stories we tell ourselves about what we observe, not from the observations themselves.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>The role of stories:</strong> Stories are the link between what we observe and how we feel and act. They provide rationale for what's happening. Once told, stories control us&mdash;how we feel, how we act, and the results we get.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Three Clever Stories:</strong> Self-justifying stories that allow us to feel good about behaving badly. <strong>Victim</strong> stories make us innocent sufferers. <strong>Villain</strong> stories turn others into bad guys. <strong>Helpless</strong> stories make us powerless to act.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Why do different people have different emotional responses to the same situation? Because they tell different stories.</li>
                    <li>Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories.</li>
                    <li>If we take control of our stories, they won't control us.</li>

                <h4>Answer Key (Discussion Break #2)</h4>
                <p><strong>Getting back to facts:</strong> Facts help us abandon absolute certainty and open up to dialogue. Getting back to observable behaviors separates our interpretations from reality, creating space for alternative explanations.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Humanizing others:</strong> Asking "Why would a reasonable person do this?" softens emotions and provides alternative explanations. It's not about excusing bad behavior&mdash;it's about getting ourselves in a position to have meaningful dialogue.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Our role in the problem:</strong> Asking about our role forces us to face up to our contribution. It jars us out of victim stories and into accountability. Most often, our role is silent complicity&mdash;we've said nothing.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Hot words" (scowl, sarcastic, controlling) are story, not fact&mdash;ask "Can I see or hear this?"</li>
                    <li>Empathy often replaces judgment when we search for plausible answers.</li>
                    <li>The goal: deal with our own stories and emotions first, then enter dialogue.</li>
