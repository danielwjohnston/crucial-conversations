            <h2>Core Message</h2><h3>When safety is at risk, step out of the content and rebuild safety</h3><p>People never become defensive about <em>what </em> you're saying—they become defensive because of <em>why </em> they think you're saying it.</p><p><strong>Safety is about intent, not content.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Step Out, Make It Safe, Step Back In</h2><h4>1. Notice safety is at risk</h4><p>Watch for silence or violence</p><h4>2.

            <h2>Two Conditions of Safety</h2><p>For people to feel safe, they need to know two things about your intent: </p><h4><span>Mutual Purpose </span></h4><p><strong>The Entrance Condition </strong></p><p>Others perceive you're working toward a common outcome—you care about their goals, interests, and values</p><p><em>A surefire mutual purpose: seek mutual understanding </em></p><h4><span>Mutual Respect </span></h4><p><strong>The Continuance Condition </strong></p><p>Others perceive that you respect them as human beings</p><p><em>Respect is like air—when it's gone, it's all people think about </em></p>

            <h3>Discussion Break</h3>
            <h2>Discussion Break #1</h2><p>Think of a time when you felt unsafe in a conversation. Which condition was violated—mutual purpose or mutual respect? How did you know, and what happened to the dialogue once that condition broke down?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Four Skills to Build Safety</h2><h3>Use these to build safety up front or rebuild when it's lost</h3><h4>1. Share Your Good Intent</h4><p>State what you want for everyone</p><h4>2. Apologize When Appropriate</h4><p>Express sorrow for your role</p><h4>3. Contrast (Don't/Do)</h4><p>Clarify what you don't and do intend</p><h4>4. Create <span>Mutual Purpose </span>(<span>CRIB </span>)</h4><p>When truly at cross purposes</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Share Good Intent & Apologize</h2><h3>Share Your Good Intent</h3><p>It's not enough to <em>have </em> good intentions—the other person must <em>know </em> that's the case.</p><p><em>“Our relationship is the most important thing in the world to me. Could we talk about what happened?”</em></p><h3>Apologize When Appropriate</h3><p>When you've clearly violated respect, sincerely express sorrow for your role. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning.</p><p><em>“I'm sorry I didn't give you a call. You worked all night, and I didn't even explain what happened. I apologize.”</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Contrast to Fix Misunderstandings</h2><p>A <strong>don't/do </strong> statement that addresses concerns about your intent: </p><h4>Don't Part</h4><p>Address concerns that you don't respect them or have malicious purpose</p><p><em>“I don't want you to think I'm criticizing you...”</em></p><h4>Do Part</h4><p>Clarify what your real intention is</p><p><em>“I do want us to talk about our concerns so we can build our relationship.”</em></p><strong>Pro tip: </strong> Don't wait until safety breaks—use contrasting preventively to set expectations at the start of tough conversations.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Create Mutual Purpose: <span>CRIB </span></h2><h3>When you're truly at cross purposes</h3><h3><strong>C </strong> ommit to seek mutual purpose</h3><p>“I commit to stay in this discussion until we find something that serves both of us.”</p><h3><strong>R </strong> ecognize the purpose behind the strategy</h3><p>Ask WHY they want what they're asking for. Separate demands from underlying purpose.</p><h3><strong>I </strong> nvent a mutual purpose</h3><p>If still at odds, find a higher or longer-term purpose that's more motivating.</p><h3><strong>B </strong> rainstorm new strategies</h3><p>With mutual purpose clear, jointly search for solutions that serve everyone.</p>

            <h3>Discussion Break</h3>
            <h2>Discussion Break #2</h2><p>Which of the four safety skills feels most natural to you, and which feels hardest? Think of a time you were arguing over <em>what </em> to do instead of <em>why </em>—how could <span>CRIB </span> have helped you get unstuck?</p>

                <p><strong><span class="term" data-def="Mutual Purpose: Others believe you care about their goals and interests, not just your own">Mutual Purpose</span>:</strong> The entrance condition. If others believe you&#39;re working toward a common outcome and care about their interests, they&#39;ll feel safe enough to begin. A surefire starting purpose: seek mutual understanding.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong><span class="term" data-def="Mutual Respect: Others believe you respect them as a person, even during disagreement">Mutual Respect</span>:</strong> The continuance condition. Even with shared purpose, if people feel disrespected, dialogue stops and becomes about defending dignity. Respect is like air&mdash;invisible until it&#39;s gone.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Key insight:</strong> People don&#39;t become defensive about what you say&mdash;they become defensive about why they think you&#39;re saying it. Safety is about perceived intent.</p>

                <p><strong>Share Good Intent:</strong> Start by making your positive intentions explicit. Don&#39;t assume people know your motives.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Apologize:</strong> Requires a genuine change of heart&mdash;giving up saving face or being right to focus on what you really want.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Contrast:</strong> A don&#39;t/do statement. Address fears first (don&#39;t), then clarify real intent (do). Works even better as prevention than repair.</p>
