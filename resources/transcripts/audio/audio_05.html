        <p>Spot the story by watching for hot words. To avoid confusing story with fact, watch for hot terms. For example, when assessing the facts, you might say she scowled at me or he made a sarcastic comment. Words such as scowl and sarcastic are hot terms. They express judgments and attributions that, in turn create strong emotions. They are story, not fact. Notice how much different it is when you say, her eyes pinched shut and her lips tightened, as opposed to she scowled at me. In Maria's case, she suggested that Lewis was controlling and didn't respect her. Had she focused on his behavior, he talked a lot and met with the boss one on one. This less volatile description would have allowed for any number of interpretations. For example, perhaps Lewis was nervous, concerned or unsure of himself, removing hot words and getting down to the basic facts is harder than it sounds. For example, as Maria works to separate fact from story, she might go through a few iterations of removing judgments. First attempt all story. Lewis violated our plan, stole my slides and forced me to the sidelines. Second attempt, some facts. Louis stole 10 of the slides I was supposed to cover and never once looked at me to answer questions. Third attempt, more facts, Lewis covered 10 of the slides we previously agreed I would cover when questions were asked, he answered all of them. Scan for other facts. Once we start to tell a story, Lewis is a power hungry weasel, we start to selectively see the evidence or facts that reinforce our story, and we overlook facts that contradict our story.</p>
        <p>We believe our story and want to continue to believe it, thus we only see that which helps us continue to believe as we retrace our path and get back to the facts, we need to take another look at all the facts. Were there things that we in the throes of our story overlooked? For example, if Maria has previously told herself a story about Louis, she'll unconsciously be looking for facts that back that story up. We all like to be right, so we look for confirming data and we overlook or dismiss anything that contradicts it. As Maria scans for additional facts, perhaps she notices that Louis works really well with Cena, a colleague she respects, or that Lewis praised Maria's work in a team meeting last month as she liberates herself from the need to defend her story, Maria's list of facts might grow to include fourth attempt, even more Facts Louis covered 10 of the slides we previously agreed I would cover, and I let him when questions were asked, he answered them without checking if I wanted to, and I did not step in to offer my view. As you scan for other facts to complete the picture, be sure to ask, what facts are there that contradict my story? Watch for three clever stories. As you learn to question and analyze your stories. Pay close attention to an insidious and common type of story, the self justifying story, for example, you're faced with a Crucial Conversation. Rather than engaging in productive dialog, you either shut down or push back, recognizing, on some level, your own bad behavior, you quickly come up with a perfectly plausible reason why what you did was okay. Of course, I yelled at him.</p>
        <p>Did you see what he did? He deserved it. Or hey, don't you dare judge me for not speaking up. I don't have a choice. I have to keep this job. We call these imaginative and self serving concoctions, clever stories. They're clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly, even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify our ineffective behavior or disconnect ourselves from our bad results, we tend to tell ourselves stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional life. Victim stories, it's not my fault. The first of the clever stories is a victim story. Victim stories, as you might imagine, make us out to be innocent sufferers. The theme is always the same, we are good, right? Brilliant or righteous, and the other people or the world at large is aligned against us. We suffer through absolutely no fault of our own. We are innocent. There is such a thing as an innocent victim. You're stopped in the street and held up at gunpoint when an event such as this occurs, it's a sad fact, not a story, you are a victim. But not all tales of victimization are so clear, cut and one sided within most crucial conversations, when you tell a victim's story, you intentionally ignore the role you've played in the problem. You tell your story in a way that judiciously avoids whatever you have done or neglected to do that might have contributed to the problem. For instance, last week, your boss took you off a big project, and it hurt your feelings.</p>
        <p>You complained to everyone about how bad you felt. What you did not explain was that you failed to let your boss know that you were behind on an important project, leaving him high and dry, which is why he removed you in the first place. This part of the story, you leave out because, hey, he made you feel bad. To help support your victim. Stories, you speak of nothing but your noble motives. I took longer because I was trying to beat the standard specs. Then you tell yourself that you're being punished for your virtues, not your vices. He just doesn't appreciate a person with my superb attention to detail, this added twist turns you from a victim into a martyr. What a bonus villain stories. It's all your fault. We create these nasty little Tales by turning normal, decent human beings into villains. We impute bad motive, and then we tell everyone about the evils of the other party as if somehow we're doing the world a huge favor. We ignore any of our villains virtues and turn their flaws into exaggerated indictments. For example, we describe a boss who is zealous about quality as a control freak. When our spouse is upset that we didn't keep a commitment, we see him or her as inflexible and stubborn. In victim stories, we exaggerate our own innocence. In villain stories, we over emphasize the other person's guilt or stupidity. We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence, while ignoring any possible good or neutral intentions or skills a person may have. Often, we'll dehumanize our villain further by replacing his or her name with a label.</p>
        <p>For example, I can't believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again by employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead. Not only do villains stories help us blame others for bad results, they also set us up to then do whatever we want to the villains. After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead or a lawyer, whereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person. Then when we fail to get the results we really want. We stay stuck in our ineffective behavior, because after all, look who we're dealing with, sometimes we go beyond villainizing individuals to villainizing entire communities of people. Those Yahoos in engineering have no idea what it takes to sell our product lawyers, you can't trust a single one. Taking an individual human being, lumping the person into a broad category, and then rejecting that entire group of people allows us to be both angry at them and dismiss them all at once, heartbreakingly villainizing groups and communities continually perpetuates mistreatment and oppression. Watch for the double standard. When you pay attention to victim and villain stories and catch them for what they are unfair caricatures, you begin to see the terrible double standard we use when our emotions are out of control, when we make mistakes, we tell a victim story by claiming our intentions were innocent and pure. Sure I was late getting home and didn't call you, but I couldn't let the team down. On the other hand, when others do things that hurt or inconvenience us, we tell villain stories in which we invent terrible motives or exaggerate flaws for others based on how their actions affected us. You are so thoughtless.</p>
        <p>You could have called me and told me you were going to be late, helpless stories. There's nothing else I. Do finally come helpless stories. In these fabrications, we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful. We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament which justifies the actions we're about to take. A helpless story might suggest, if I didn't yell at my son, he wouldn't listen, or on the flip side, if I told the boss this, he would just be defensive. So of course, I say nothing while villain and victim stories look back to explain why we're in the situation we're in helpless stories look forward to explain why we can't do anything to change our situation. It's particularly easy to act helpless when we turn others behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a control freak, a villain story, we are less inclined to give her feedback, because, after all, control freaks like her don't accept feedback. A helpless story, nothing we can do will change that fact. As you can see, helpless stories often stem from villain stories, and typically offer us nothing more than fools choices we can either be honest and ruin the relationship, or stay silent and suffer. Why we tell clever stories? By now, it should be clear that clever stories cause us problems. A reasonable question at this point is, if they're so terribly hurtful, why do we ever tell clever stories? There are two reasons clever stories match reality. Sometimes the stories we tell are accurate. The other person is trying to cause us harm. We are innocent victims, or maybe we really can't do much about the problem.</p>
        <p>It can happen. It's not common, but it can happen. Clever stories justify our actions, more often than not, our conclusions transform from reasonable explanations to clever stories when they conveniently excuse us from any responsibility, when in reality, we have been partially responsible. The other person isn't bad and wrong and we aren't right and good, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. However, if we can make others out as wrong and ourselves out as right, we're off the hook. Better yet, once we've demonized others, we can even insult and abuse them if we want, our need to tell clever stories often starts with our own sell outs, like it or not, we usually don't begin telling stories that justify our actions until we've done something that we feel a need to justify. We sell out when we consciously act against our own sense of what's right, and if we don't admit to our errors, we inevitably look for ways to justify them. That's when we begin to tell clever stories. Recall that when Joseph walked in the door after a week of travel and heard the phone ring, he knew what he should do. He had a clear call of conscience to ignore the phone and focus on his wife, but he didn't. That was the moment he began formulating a clever story. He turned sila into a villain, she is so unappreciative, and himself into a victim. I've been working hard all week and deserve understanding. And voila, he felt justified in behaving terribly and blamed sila for ruining their reunion. Let's look at another example of a sell out. You're driving in heavy traffic. You begin to pass cars that are attempting to merge into your lane.</p>
        <p>A car very near you has accelerated and is entering your lane. A thought strikes you that you should let him in. It's the nice thing to do, and you'd want someone to let you in, but you don't, you accelerate forward and close the gap. What happens next? You begin to have thoughts like these. He can't just crowd in on me. What a jerk. I've been fighting this traffic a long time. Besides, I've got an important appointment to get to and so on. This story makes you the innocent victim and the other person, the nasty villain. Under the influence of this story, you now feel justified in not doing what you originally thought you should have done, you also ignore what you would think of others who did the same thing to you. That jerk didn't let me in. Consider an example more related to Crucial Conversations. There is a new member of your team at work. He is significantly less experienced than you and eager to learn. He keeps coming to you and asking questions. Sometimes he asks the same question he asked yesterday. You're starting to get tired of holding his hand. You. He is taking so much time that your own work is backing up. You know, you should start saying no to many of his requests and direct him to other resources, but you don't. Instead, you start giving him really Curt or abrupt answers, hoping he will get the hint he doesn't. Your annoyance turns to resentment. You stop responding to his emails and set your instant message tool to away, hoping to avoid him entirely. When he notices your behavior and asks you why, you dodge with a half truth, I'm just really busy.</p>
        <p>You feel a little guilty about avoiding him in an effort to feel better about your actions, you start complaining to other team members about all the time he's taking from you and how much help he needs. Who hired this guy anyway? Notice the order of the events in both these examples, what came first the story or the sell out? Did you convince yourself of the other driver's selfishness and then not let him in. Of course, not. You had no reason to think he was selfish until you needed an excuse for your own selfish behavior. You didn't start telling clever stories until after you failed to do something you knew you should have done. Your co workers needs didn't become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem. You got upset because you sold out, and the clever story helped you feel good about being rude. Sellouts are often not big events. In fact, they can be so small that they're easy for us to overlook when we're crafting our clever stories. Here are some common ones. You believe you should help someone, but you don't. You believe you should apologize, but don't. You believe you should stay late to finish up on a commitment, but go home instead. You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no one follows up to see if you keep your commitment. You believe you should talk to someone about concerns you have with him or her, but don't you do less than your share, and think you should acknowledge it, but say nothing, knowing no one else will bring it up. Either. You believe you should listen respectfully to feedback, but become defensive instead.</p>
        <p>You see problems with a plan someone presents and think you should speak up, but don't you fail to complete an assignment on time, and believe you should let others know, but don't you know you have information a co worker could use, but keep it to yourself. Even small sellouts like these get us started telling clever stories when we don't admit to our own mistakes. We obsess about others' faults, our innocence and our powerlessness to do anything other than what we're already doing. We tell a clever story when we want self justification more than results. Of course, self justification is not what we really want, but we certainly act as if it is. With that sad fact in mind, let's focus on what we really want. Let's look at the final mastermind stories skill tell the rest of the story. Once we've learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final mastermind stories. Skill the best at dialog recognize that they're telling clever stories, stop and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy actions such as dialog and what transforms a clever story into a useful one the rest of the story. That's because clever stories have one characteristic in common. They're incomplete. Clever stories omit crucial information about us, about others and about our options, only by including all these essential details can clever stories be transformed into useful ones? What's the best way to fill in the missing details? Quite simply, it's done by turning victims into actors, villains into humans and the helpless into the Able. Here's how turn victims into actors.</p>
        <p>If you notice that you're talking about yourself as an innocent victim and you weren't held up at gunpoint, ask, what am i Pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, just maybe you did something to help cause the problem. Instead of being a victim, you were an actor. This doesn't necessarily mean you had malicious motives. Perhaps your contribution was merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed, for example, a. Co worker constantly leaves the harder or noxious tasks for you to complete. You frequently complain to friends and loved ones about being exploited. The parts you leave out of the story are that you smile broadly when your boss compliments you for your willingness to take on the challenging jobs, and you've never said anything to your coworker, you've hinted, but that's about it. More often than not, when faced with persistent or recurrent problems, the role we are playing and are pretending not to notice is one of silent complicity. The problem has been going on for a while, and we have said nothing. Our role is silence. The first step in telling the rest of this story would be to add these important facts to your account. By asking what role you've played. You begin to realize how selective your perception has been. You become aware of how you've minimized your own mistakes while exaggerating the role of others. Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask, why would a reasonable, rational and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others as we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften.</p>
        <p>Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending on how we've treated others, personal accountability replaces self justification. For instance, that coworker who seems to conveniently miss out on the tough jobs. Told you recently that she could see you were struggling with an important assignment, and yesterday, while you were tied up on a pressing task, she pitched in and completed the job for you. You were instantly suspicious she was trying to make you look bad by completing a high profile job. How dare she pretend to be helpful when her real goal was to discredit you while tooting her own horn. Well, that's the story you've told yourself. But what if she really were a reasonable, rational and decent person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a hand? Isn't it a bit early to be vilifying her, and if you do, don't you run the risk of ruining a relationship? Might you go off half cocked, accuse her and then learn you were wrong. Our purpose for asking why a reasonable, rational and decent person might be acting a certain way is not to excuse others for any bad things they may be doing. If they are indeed guilty. We'll have time to deal with that later. The purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves, first, by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person's behavior. In fact, with experience and maturity, we learn to worry less about others intent and more about the effect others actions are having on us.</p>
        <p>No longer are we in the game of rooting out unhealthy motives when we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialog, the only reliable way of discovering others genuine motives turn the helpless into able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive to do so, stop and ask, what do I really want? For me, for others, for the relationship? Then break free of the fool's choice that made you feel helpless to choose anything other than going on the attack or staying silent. Do this by asking, What should I do right now to move toward what I really want? For example, you now find yourself insulting your coworker for not pitching in with a tough job. Your coworker seems surprised at your strong and out of the blue reaction. In fact, she's staring at you as if you've slipped a cog. You, of course, have told yourself that she is purposely avoiding noxious tasks, and that despite your helpful hints, she has made no changes. I have to get brutal. You tell yourself, I don't like it, but if I don't offend her, I'll be stuck. You've strayed from what you really want, to share, work equally and to have a good relationship. You've given up on half your goals by making a fool's choice. Oh, well, better to offend her than to be made a fool. What should you be doing instead? Openly, honestly?</p>
        <p>And effectively discussing the problem, not taking pot shots and then justifying yourself when you refuse to make yourself helpless, you're forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialog skills rather than bemoaning your weaknesses. The hostage negotiator. When we humanize others, we're not excusing bad behaviors or motives. We're helping ourselves be in a place to have a meaningful and successful, Crucial Conversation. Co author Ron McMillan learned about the value of this principle from a man in a very high risk occupation. Hear about it in the video the hostage negotiator@crucialconversations.com Maria's news story. To see how this all fits together, let's circle back to Maria. Let's assume she retraced her path to action and separated the facts from the stories. Doing this has helped her realize that the story she told was incomplete, defensive, hurtful. When she watched for the three clever stories, she saw them with painful clarity. Now she's ready to tell the rest of the story. So she asks herself, what am i Pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? When I found out that Lewis was holding project meetings without me, I felt like I should ask him about why I wasn't included. I believed that if I did, I could open a dialog that would help us work better together. But then I didn't, and as my resentment grew, I was even less interested in broaching the subject during the presentation. I chose not to interrupt when he started covering my slides, and I sulked rather than speaking up when he failed to invite me to take questions. Why would a reasonable, rational and decent person do what Lewis is doing. He really cares about producing good quality work.</p>
        <p>Maybe he doesn't realize that I am as committed to the success of the project as he is. His actions in the meeting might have been about his nervousness, rather than judgment of me. What do I really want? I want a respectful relationship with Lewis, and I want to be treated with respect. What should I do right now to move toward what I really want, I'd make an appointment to sit down with Lewis and talk about how the presentation went and how we work together. As we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialog, we become masters of our own emotions, rather than hostages. And what about Maria? What did she actually do? She scheduled a meeting with Lewis. After Maria explained her expectations and views of the project, Lewis apologized for not including her in the meetings with the boss. He explained that he was trying to give the boss a heads up on some controversial parts of the presentation and realized in retrospect that he shouldn't have done this without her. He also apologized for dominating during the presentation. Maria learned from the conversation that Lewis tends to talk more when he gets nervous. He suggested that they each be responsible for either the first or second half of the presentation and stick to their assignments so he would be less likely to crowd her out. The discussion ended with both of them understanding the other's perspective and Lewis promising to be more sensitive in the future. My Crucial Conversation Marion B after 25 years in my organization, I was one move away from a cabinet level position.</p>
        <p>However, no matter how many times I applied and interviewed for such positions, I was never selected as I was passed over again and again. I began to tell myself stories about it, but I said nothing. After becoming a trainer for Crucial Conversations. I took another look at my situation, and I realized there was a conversation I was not having. I had not asked the leaders in my organization what was preventing me from moving forward. It was tough medicine. But as I learned about mastering my story, I realized that at first I had remained silent by telling myself it was just bad luck. As the luck story wore thin, it became a politics story. Others were better at buttering up the right people. I had lost out because I had integrity. My victim and villain stories were keeping me silent and resentful. After many hours of reflection, I got to a news story. Part of being passed over was because I had not asked for feedback. I was no longer a victim. I was an actor, and I decided to take action. The conversation was tough. I was told that in order to move to a cabinet level position. That I would first have to take a cabinet level position in a smaller organization. That information rang true, but I didn't like it. However, I was now in a position to make a decision. So I did. I left my organization and got a job leading a department four times larger than the one where I previously worked. Had I not finally faced my story, I would not have gotten the results I wanted most. Summary, Master my stories. If strong emotions are keeping you stuck in silence or violence, try these steps. Retrace your path.</p>
        <p>Examine your behavior. If you find yourself moving away from dialog, ask yourself what you're really doing. Put your feelings into words. Learn to accurately identify and name the emotions behind your story. Ask what emotions are encouraging me to act this way. Spot your story, identify your story. Ask, what story must I be telling? It to create these emotions, separate fact from story, abandon your absolute certainty by distinguishing between hard facts and your invented story. Ask, what evidence do I have to support this story. Watch for clever stories, victim, villain and helpless stories sit at the top of the list. Tell the rest of the story. Ask, what am i Pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? Why would a reasonable, rational and decent person do this? What do I really want? What should I do right now to move toward what I really want?</p>
