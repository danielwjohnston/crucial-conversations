        <p>In Chapter 13, putting it all together, tools for preparing and learning. I can win any argument. People know this and steer clear of me at parties, often as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me. Dave Barry, if you've listened to this point in a short period of time, you probably feel like an anaconda that just swallowed a Warthog. It's a lot to digest. You may well be wondering at this point how you can possibly keep all of these ideas straight, especially during something as unpredictable and fast moving as a crucial conversation. This chapter will help with the daunting task of making dialog tools and skills memorable and usable. We'll simplify things by sharing what we've heard from people who have changed their lives by using these skills. Then we'll walk you through an example of a crucial conversation where all the dialog principles are applied two key principles. Over the years, we've learned a lot about how various people turn these ideas into new habits. Some people make progress by picking one skill that they know will help them get to dialog in a current Crucial Conversation. Simply taking action using a new tool is a great way to start. If doing so leads to better results, you're more likely to persist in using it until it becomes a habit. Others focus less on skills and more on principles. For example, get started with increasing your capacity to get to dialog by becoming more conscious of these two principles, learn to look. The first principle for positive change is learn to look. That is, people who improve their dialog skills continually ask themselves whether they're in or out of dialog. This alone makes a huge difference.</p>
        <p>Even people who can't remember or never learned the skills of state or amp or cure, etc, are able to benefit from this material by simply asking if they or others are falling into silence or violence. They may not know exactly how to fix the specific problem they're facing, but they do know that if they're not in dialog, it can't be good. And then they try something to get back into dialog. As it turns out, trying something is better than doing nothing. So remember to ask the following important question, are we playing games, or are we in dialog? It's a wonderful start. Many people get additional help in learning to look from their friends. They study the book or go through training as families or teams, as they share concepts and ideas, they learn a common vocabulary. This shared way of talking about Crucial Conversations helps people change, perhaps the most common way that the language of dialog finds itself into everyday conversation is with the statement. I think we've moved away from dialog this simple reminder helps people catch themselves early on before the damage is severe. As we've watched executive teams work groups and couples simply go public with the fact that they're starting to move towards silence or violence. Others often recognize the problem and take corrective action. You're right. I'm not telling you what needs to be said or I'm sorry I've been trying to force my ideas on you. Make it safe. The second principle is make it safe. We've suggested that dialog consists of the free flow of meaning, and that the number one flow stopper is a lack of safety. When you notice that you and others have moved away from dialog, do something to make it safer, anything.</p>
        <p>We've suggested a few skills, but those are merely a handful of common practices. They're not all inclusive. To no one's surprise, there are many things you can do to increase safety if you simply realize that your challenge is to make it safer. Nine out of 10 times, you'll intuitively do something that helps. Sometimes you'll build safety by asking a question and showing interest in others views, sometimes an appropriate touch with loved ones and family members, not at work, where touching can equate with harassment, can communicate safety apologies, smiles, even a request for a brief time out can help restore safety when things get dicey, the main idea is to make it safe. Do something to generate evidence that you care about others interests and that you respect them. And remember, virtually every skill we've covered in this book, from contrasting to priming, offers a tool for building safety and. These two levers form the basis for recognizing, building and maintaining dialog when the concept of dialog is introduced, these are the ideas most people can readily take in and apply to Crucial Conversations. Let's see how it all works. We've included an extended case here to show you how these principles might look when you find yourself in the middle of a crucial conversation. It outlines a tough discussion between you and your sister about dividing your mother's estate. The case is set up to illustrate where the principles apply and to briefly review each principle as it comes up in the conversation. The conversation begins with you bringing up the subject of the family summer house. Your mother's funeral was a month ago, and now it's time to split up both money and keepsakes. You're not really looking forward to it.</p>
        <p>The issue is made touchier by the fact that you feel that since you almost single handedly cared for your mother during the last several years, you should be compensated. You don't think your sister will see things the same way. Your crucial conversation, you we have to sell the summer cottage. We never use it, and we need the cash to pay for my expenses from taking care of mom the past four years, Sister, please don't start with the guilt. I sent you money every month to help take care of mom. If I didn't have to travel for my job, you know, I would have wanted her at my house. You notice that emotions are already getting strong. You're getting defensive, and your sister seems to be angry. You're in a crucial conversation, and it's not starting Well, choose your topic. You've got multiple topics competing for your attention. How will you be reimbursed? How will you divide the remaining assets? Are there hurt feelings over care taking? Is there mistrust or feelings of disrespect between you and your sister? Is grief over your mother's death, mixing in and on and on, you can't make progress until you agree on a topic. Since all the topics are important, you choose to show you care about your sister's feelings by letting her decide you priming. It sounds like we need to talk about some other things before we can get to the cottage issue. Do you think I've acted resentful about how you participated in mom's care at the end? Is that what you'd like to discuss start with heart.</p>
        <p>Pause and ask yourself what you really want this is best done prior to getting together with your sister that way, when she becomes emotional, you've got a longer term perspective that helps keep you on course. Ultimately, you want to be compensated fairly for the extra time and money you put in that your sister didn't you also want a good relationship with your sister you know she is grieving and may even be feeling guilty about not having been as involved at the end, you want to support her in working through those feelings, but you want to avoid making a fool's choice. So going into this topic, ask yourself, How can I ensure I'm treated fairly and still be supportive of my sister? Master my stories. You recognize that you're telling yourself victim and villain stories. You felt resentful towards your sister because she has been involved less, but you also never shared those feelings with her. You turned her into a villain because that was easier than asking her to help out more. You tell the rest of the story by asking, What am i Pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? You can see clearly that you never spoke up about your needs, and now blame her for not guessing that you wanted help. You ask yourself, why would a reasonable, rational and decent person have done what she did? This helps you see the fact that your mother lived one kilometer away from you, and your sister lived a two hour plane flight away, and that has a lot to do with how things turned out. Sure, your sister could have volunteered more, but there's more going on here than a lazy, uncaring sister.</p>
        <p>You're now emotionally ready to open your mouth, learn to look, come into the conversation, engaging at two levels, content and process. Pay attention to what your sister is saying content, but also pay attention to signs that safety is at risk. Process. Your sister moved to violence with her response to your proposal about compensation, she became accusatory and raised her voice, using learn to look you recognize this as a sign that she feels unsafe. Make it safe, contrast to help your sister understand your purpose, if people trust your intent. They feel safer dealing with touchy content. You I know we've both got a lot of feelings right now about a lot of things. We're grieving, and we have problems to solve. We have some history as siblings. I do want to work out the practical problems we have in a way that's fair to both of us. I don't want to suggest that these financial concerns have anything to do with how much you loved mom, but I also want to be sure you know I love you and I'm here for you as you're grieving. I need you too before we get to the expense stuff, what can I do to support you? Sister? Of course, I wish I could have been there more at the end, I feel awful about letting her down and letting you down, but I also feel like you've used that against me. Retake your pen. It's tough to hear your sister's allegation that you've been intentionally guilt tripping her. At first, you feel defensive and want to lash out, but you take a breath and you remind yourself that her opinion of you doesn't define you.</p>
        <p>You remind yourself that her feelings are hers, and you shift to a place of curiosity to understand her path to action. Why does she feel the way she does? Explore others paths priming you ask, it sounds like you've experienced things from me that make you think I have a grudge about how things went at the end. Is that right? What have I done that looked like that? As your sister continues to open up, you realize you have acted out, rather than talked out some of your concerns. You apologize for that. You acknowledge that you have felt resentful at times and that some of those feelings were unfair, given how easy it was for you to help and how hard it was for her having resolved that issue, you move to the next topic. State, my path. You still want to resolve your concerns about compensation, you can we talk about expenses now, you need to share your facts and conclusions with your sister in a way that will make her feel safe telling her story you. It's just that I spent a lot of money taking care of mom and did a lot of work caring for her instead of bringing in a nurse. I know you cared about mom too, but I honestly feel like I did more in the day to day caregiving than you did, and it only seems fair to use some of what she left us to repay a part of what I spent. Do you see it differently? I'd really like to hear sister. Okay, fine. Why don't you just send me a bill? It sounds as though your sister isn't really okay with this arrangement.</p>
        <p>You can tell her voice is tense and her tone is one of giving in, not of true agreement. Explore other's paths, since part of your objective is to maintain a good relationship with your sister. It's important that she add her meaning to the pool, use the inquiry skills to actively explore her views. You mirror the way you say. That makes it sound like maybe that suggestion isn't okay with you. Ask, is there something I'm missing? Sister, no, if you feel like you deserve more than I do, you're probably right. You prime. Do you think I'm being unfair that I'm not acknowledging your contributions? Sister, it's just that I know I wasn't around much in the last couple of years. I've had to travel a lot for work, but I still visited whenever I could, and I sent money every month to help contribute to mom's care. I offered to help pay to bring in a nurse if you thought it was necessary, I didn't know. You felt you had an unfair share of the responsibility, and it seems like you're asking for more money is coming out of nowhere. You paraphrase so you felt like you were doing everything you could to help out, and are surprised that I feel like I should be compensated. Sister. Well, yes, you understand your sister's story now and still disagree to a point, use the ABC skills to explain how your views differ. You agree in part with how your sister sees things. Use building to emphasize what you agree with and to bring up what you differ on you You're right.</p>
        <p>You did a lot to help out, and I realized that it was expensive to visit as often as you did, I opted not to pay for professional home health care because mom was more comfortable with me taking care of her, and I didn't mind that. I never told you I was doing that, and never set an expectation that I might be treated differently in the estate division because of it. That's on me. I still think it's a reasonable request on. My part to be recognized financially for helping avoid the home health nurse expense, but I didn't give you a chance to weigh in on that before making that decision. There were also some incidental expenses. It doesn't sound like you were aware of the new medication she was on during the last 18 months was twice as expensive as the old, and the insurance only covered a percentage of her hospital stays. It adds up. Sister. So it's these expenses you're worried about covering. Could we go over these expenses to decide how to cover them? Move to action. You want to create a definite plan for being reimbursed for these expenses, and you want it to be one you both agree on, come to a consensus about what will happen, document who does what by when, and settle on a way to follow up. You, I've kept a record of all the expenses that went over that amount both of us agreed to contribute. Can we sit down tomorrow and go over those and talk about what's fair to reimburse me for sister. Okay, we'll talk about the estate and write up a plan for how to divide things up. Getting to dialog.</p>
        <p>You and your sister still have a lot to work through, but getting all your meaning into the pool and encouraging your sister to add hers got you to dialog with a free flow of meaning, your future discussions are likely to be more helpful and less painful than if you hadn't stepped up to this conversation and handled it well. My Crucial Conversation, Afton p1 summer, my husband secured a coveted internship in Geneva, Switzerland, working for the United Nations. While we were there, I befriended the Geneva representative for a non governmental organization, an NGO for women. She was gearing up for the upcoming sub commission on the promotion and protection of human rights. Believing in the importance of this committee's work, I became involved in their efforts to seek un support to prevent human rights abuses to children. The focus was on child abduction and safety, and specifically the oppression of religious expression, child soldiers and young girls being sold into sex slavery. These abhorrent practices were being largely ignored by officials of some countries as the committee got to work planning the report we would present to the sub commission, I became concerned about what was and wasn't being shared. It was strongly suggested by the committee chair of our NGO that we avoid mentioning specific country names where the grievances were taking place. As a 22 year old student, not steeped in politics, I asked, why not? The committee said it had to take extreme caution not to offend certain country officials who looked the other way regarding these abuses for fear of damaging relationships. I was in a predicament.</p>
        <p>I wanted to promote real change, but I believed our report would hold little weight if we just talked in general terms, and I was afraid of losing a powerful opportunity in this forum, I immediately thought about the book crucial conversations, and was kicking myself for not having brought it with me, who knew I'd need it on my summer abroad in Switzerland. Thankfully, I remembered the basics and I drew on its principles as I expressed my belief that it was possible to be both candid and respectful in presenting delicate information. To my surprise, they invited me to rewrite the report. I was thrilled, but also terrified about the potential harm I could cause if I wasn't very careful in addressing people from many nations with diverse cultures, I spent almost every waking hour and several sleepless nights trying to carefully script an honest yet respectful portrayal of the issues by stating the facts and focusing on a mutual purpose, human rights for suffering children. The committee agreed my version was more forthright and showed appropriate sensitivity. The surprises continued. 10 days before the presentation, the committee asked me to present the report to the sub commission. I was both shocked and honored. Although this brought my anxiety level to a new peak, I immediately agreed to do it, and I spent the next several days and sleepless nights preparing for the event. When my turn finally came to deliver the report, I felt exhilarated and a little anxious. After I finished presenting, it appeared many in the audience were moved, and a few even had tears in their eyes. Others hurried over to ask me for a copy of my speech for networking and documenting purposes.</p>
        <p>As they approached, some were emotional, and many thanked me for raising the sensitive issues I learned many lessons through this experience, but one that stands out is the importance of realizing it is possible to be both candid and respectful with the right set of skills. Knowledge of Crucial Conversations helped me turn an intimidating experience into a memory. And meaningful opportunity to stand up for something I believed. In conclusion, it's not about communication, it's about results. Let's end where we started. We began this book by suggesting we got dragged somewhat unwillingly into the topic of communication. What we were most interested in was not writing a book on communication. Rather, we wanted to identify crucial moments, moments when people's actions disproportionately affect their organizations, their relationships and their lives. Our research led us, time and again, to focus on moments when people need to step up to emotionally and politically risky conversations. That's why we came to call these moments Crucial Conversations. We found that time and again, what stands between us and what we really want is lag time. The problem isn't that we have problems. The problem is the lag time between when we know we have them and when we find a way to effectively confront, discuss and resolve them. If you reduce this lag time, everything gets better. Our sole motivation in writing this book has been to help you improve the results you care about most and our dearest hope as we conclude it is that you will do so, take action, identify a crucial conversation you could improve. Now use the tools in this last chapter to identify the principle or skill that will help you approach it in a more effective way than you ever have.</p>
        <p>Then give it a try. One thing our research shows clearly is that you need not be perfect to make progress. You needn't worry if you make only stuttering progress. We promise you that if you persist and work at these ideas, you will see dramatic improvement in your relationships and results. These moments are truly crucial, and a little bit of change can lead to an enormous amount of progress.</p>
