        <p>Chapter Three, choose your topic, how to be sure you hold the right conversation. A problem well stated is a problem half solved. Charles Kettering, the moment you open your mouth to hold a crucial conversation, you've already made a decision. You've decided what to talk about. One of the biggest mistakes we make is assuming that just because we're talking we must be solving the right problem. It's not that simple. If you're not addressing the right issue, you'll end up in the same conversation over and over again. Crucial Conversations are topic rich environments, human interactions and relationships are complex. There are multiple issues and side issues and tangents. You've probably been in that conversation before. You think you're talking with your brother about plans for an upcoming family gathering, suddenly you're in a completely different conversation about the time your parents bought you a brand new bike because you've always been their favorite and your brother never could measure up. Whoa. You think? Where did all that come from? Crucial Conversations are most successful when they're focused on one issue, because human interactions are inherently complex. Focusing a crucial conversation on a single topic takes effort. It requires us to thoughtfully unbundle and then prioritize the issues at hand. For example, let's look at the case of Wendy and Sandrine. Wendy is a project manager at a global technology company. She's been there many years and has successfully led numerous projects, large and small. She recently began working with a new manager, Sandrine. Sandrine joined the organization a year ago with a reputation as a hard charging get things done, break eggs when needed. Executive Sandrine asked Wendy to put together a timeline for a new project, and now they're sitting down to review it.</p>
        <p>Sandrine, I'm excited to have you and your team dig in on this project. Let's talk timelines. Wendy, it will take us just over six months? Sandrine, oh, well, when I looked at it, it seemed like you should be able to finish this whole thing by the end of this quarter. At this point, we have the first element of a crucial conversation, a difference of opinion. Wendy thinks the project will take at least twice as long as Sandrine expected. Wendy, well, it's a good thing we're talking about it now, before we've made any commitments, because there's no way to finish it by then. I mean, that's half the usual time for a project like this, Sandrine, that's why I put you in this role in the first place you are able to do the impossible? Let me give you the full context of just how important this is. I need you to figure out how to get this done by the end of the quarter, other project launches are at stake. The accelerated schedules are already in the master plan. Our senior team is counting on us, or more specifically, on you, and just like that, the next two elements of a Crucial Conversation come into play. The stakes are high and emotions are rising. This is an important project for Wendy, for Sandrine and for their organization, Sandrine is feeling pressured, and is starting to apply the same pressure on Wendy. So what happens next? Wendy, wait a minute. You've already made a commitment. You agreed to a deadline before we even talked about whether it was doable. Sandrine, Hey, Wendy, you know, we need a big win this year. Look, I really pushed for you to be the one to lead this project.</p>
        <p>Do you know what I said about you? I said you were a team player. Was I mistaken? Wow, there is a lot going on in this one conversation. Wendy has put together a timeline, shared it with her manager, and, bam, the whole thing has blown up in her face. Not only does she still have to get to agreement with her manager about the project timeline, the original issue, but now there are a whole host of other issues as well. Think about what would be going through your mind right now if you were Wendy, for example. How will I ever get this project done? She's setting me up to fail. This is unfair to my team. What am I going to say to my family about the crazy, long hours I'll be putting in? Can I tell. Tell the truth about what I'm thinking right now. Will I lose my job? If I do, do I even want this career? Do I want to work for Sandrine Wendy is clearly Facing a Crucial Conversation right now, but the question is, which conversation? What should she right now, in this moment with Sandrine, talk about why we usually choose the wrong topic. When faced with complex problems like this, we rarely stop and ponder which topic we should address instead, we naturally default to one of two mistaken directions, easy over hard. When faced with high stakes, emotional conversations, we have a bias for choosing the topic we think we can win with. That usually means we pick something easier than the issue that is really in the way of our most important goals. We think I'll just start with this little issue and see how that goes.</p>
        <p>It's like we're testing the waters or trying to get across the lake without getting wet. For example, if you've concluded your direct report is incompetent at some aspect of his or her job, you might sugarcoat the problem by addressing minor, recent mistakes. Your unstated hope is that your report will infer how big the problem is without your coming out and saying it Nice try, but easy rarely works. Recent overwrite. We tend to focus on the most recent event or behavior rather than on the one that matters the most. If a colleague treats your comments in a meeting in a way you find disrespectful, you talk about the most recent slight rather than sharing the larger pattern. Hey you say after the meeting you started talking over me in there when I hadn't finished my point, your colleague shrugs and says, shoot. Sorry. I guess I got a little too enthusiastic. You say, Aha, but you think you do that all the time, you self centered jerk. We favor recent overwrite for a couple of reasons. First, we can actually remember the specifics. Second, we don't want to be accused of dredging up ancient history. Three signs you're having the wrong conversation. Falling into these traps leads to fairly predictable results. We end up having the wrong conversation, which keeps us stuck. To avoid this mistake, learn to recognize three signals that you're talking about, the wrong thing. Memorize them when you see them. Imagine a yellow warning light flashing in your mind that says wrong topic. When that light pulses, push back from the table and ask yourself, What's the real issue here.</p>
        <p>Number one, your emotions escalate when you're having the wrong conversation, even if that conversation is going well, you know on some level that you're not addressing or resolving the issue. Consequently, you come in feeling frustrated, and that feeling increases as the conversation progresses. That's happening right now to Wendy, when the conversation started, she was feeling confident in her timeline. By the end, she was apprehensive and afraid for her job. That escalated emotion should signal to her that the issue is no longer the project deadline, something more important needs to be addressed. Number two, you walk away skeptical, sure, maybe you come to the end of the conversation with an agreement, but even as you walk away, you think to yourself, nothing is going to really change here, or you get to agreement, but doubt that the changes you settled on will solve the real problem, whatever agreement you came to is only so much window dressing, because it won't get you to what you really want. Number three, you're in deja vu dialog. If you ever have the same conversation with the same people a second time, the problem is not them, it's you. You're having the wrong conversation. If even as you say the words, they feel familiar because you've had this conversation before, maybe even a dozen times, you're on the wrong topic. One of the best ways to ensure you talk about the right topic is to get good at noticing when you're on the wrong one. Memorize these three warning signs. Then every time you recognize they are happening, use them as a cue to push back from the table and ask yourself. What's the real issue? I need to address skills for finding the right topic.</p>
        <p>You've likely known someone who seems gifted at putting a finger on exactly the right issue. The conversation is swirling and churning, and suddenly the person says, you know, I think the real issue here is trust. We've lost confidence in each other, or make some other brilliant deduction of the previous 53 minutes of chaos. A dozen heads nod, and suddenly you begin making progress, because you're now talking about the real issue. How does someone do that? The answer is that this person is skilled at three elements of choosing the right topic. The person knows how to unbundle, choose and simplify the issues involved. Let's look first at unbundling, unbundle. There are three levels of conversations you may need to have about the issue itself, and a fourth relating to the process of the conversation. We'll address process later. A good way to find the right one begins by unbundling or teasing apart the various issues level by level. You can remember these levels with the acronym CPR. Content the first time a problem comes up, talk about the content the immediate pain if either the action itself or its immediate consequence are the issue, you've got a content problem. For example, your coworker failed to get you the marketing analytics you needed in order to finish a report for your manager. Now your neck is on the line because your report was late, or you're giving a presentation in a team meeting and one of your fellow team members keeps interrupting and talking over you. If this is the first time this has happened, it's a content problem pattern. The next time the same problem comes up, think pattern.</p>
        <p>Now the concern is not just that this has happened once, but that a pattern is starting to develop or already has, for example, the last three times, a really exciting project came to your team, your manager assigned it to others despite your expressed interest. The issue is no longer just one assignment, it's the pattern that's emerging. It can be challenging to determine when to move from content to pattern. Often, it may feel like you're jumping to conclusions if you move to pattern after only a second occurrence of the issue. Yet you want to address patterns early and candidly before they become entrenched. It can be helpful to think of it this way. The first time something happens, it's an incident. The second time it might be coincidence. The third time, it's a pattern relationship. Finally, as problems continue, they can begin to impact the relationship. Relationship issues get to deeper concerns about trust, competence or respect. For example, we may begin to doubt someone's competence, or question whether we can trust a person to keep commitments, or we may conclude after repeated incidents that a person doesn't respect our role or contribution. With these doubts and questions at the forefront of our thinking, we begin to subtly or overtly relate to them differently. Sometimes a relationship issue can emerge fully formed in the first instance. For example, if you see a colleague put sensitive files onto a thumb drive and take that drive home, you may have an immediate trust issue to see CPR in action. Let's take a look at a very sensitive example from a client of ours. How would you use CPR to help him decide what topic to address? I am the only non white person on my team.</p>
        <p>I've been called by the wrong name multiple times in meetings by my immediate manager after it happened three times. I corrected her in the meeting, she later gave me feedback that I shouldn't have bothered to correct my name, because all names of people of my ethnicity sound similar, so it shouldn't really make a difference to me. On another occasion, she suggested I adopt an English name. Can you see how important it is for this person to decide what the right topic is? To address unbundling helps people see a variety of options. Number one, keep it at content. Solve the immediate problem by correcting anyone who calls you by the wrong name. Number two, move to pattern. Express your concern that her referring to you by the wrong names has become a pattern. Number three, talk relationship. Let your manager know that your name is an important part of your identity, and that you feel disrespected when someone you work with regularly doesn't take the time to learn it, or perhaps even more important, you feel disrespected by the suggestion that you change it. Unbundling the issues with CPR helps us gain clarity into the situation. It also sets us up to make a conscious choice, at which level do we want to hold this conversation before we get to making that decision, though, let's consider one more issue you may want to discuss. The process of the conversation itself. Do you need to talk about process? CPR is a powerful entry point as we begin to unravel complex interactions and consider the issues that are keeping us stuck. But not every issue fits neatly into content, pattern and relationship.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, you'll need to extend your conversation to cover the issue of the process of how we are discussing issues. For example, years ago, we were coaching a senior leader, Kayla on her management style. She had a team of a dozen or so people, including an administrative assistant April. April was fairly new to the team, and Kayla was eager to develop a good working relationship with her being new. April had some things to learn, and Kayla was quick, direct and respectful in her feedback. Despite Kayla's skill in delivering feedback and coaching, April, almost inevitably became defensive. Kayla tried everything we taught her about saying things in a way that would make it safe for April to hear her skills you'll learn in later chapters, it just wasn't working. After observing a few interactions, we suggested to Kayla that this was a process problem, something about the process of how she was delivering feedback and how April was hearing it was creating the issue that was keeping them stuck. Kayla decided to make that the topic of her conversation. She set up a time to talk with April about how they were working together and how she Kayla could best provide feedback to April. She explained her intent. She wanted them to be able to work well together, and she wanted to see April succeed. That's why she gave feedback, Kayla shared using the skills in this book that she had noticed April's defensiveness and wanted to talk about a better process for delivering feedback. The conversation went well.</p>
        <p>The two were able to come to some concrete agreements about how Kayla could deliver feedback to April in a way that April could and would hear it, and April committed to expressing her emotions in ways that worked better for Kayla, taking time to address the process of how we are communicating is especially important when there are differences in our communication styles, or when our mode of Communication changes from what we're used to process issues often come into play across cultures as well. For example, we work with colleagues from across Europe and Asia, teaching crucial conversation skills while the principles are the same, there are clear and obvious variations in the ways people communicate in different cultures. One of our Dutch colleagues shared this experience of working with one of our Asian colleagues. I wanted to have a good and honest conversation about some problems we were having working together. When I invited him to share his thoughts about the situation, he hardly said a word. The conversation was a disaster. Afterwards, I sent him an email explaining that I thought the conversation was unsuccessful and that I really want to find a solution that we both felt good about. Later, we had a new conversation, but this time about process, rather than specific problems, I asked what I could have done differently. He shared with me that in his culture, he's not used to talking explicitly about what went wrong, my direct reference to our problems felt disrespectful. He said that for him, it was customary to begin by talking about how we are doing family and other such topics from a Dutch perspective, I was doing just fine.</p>
        <p>Having a process conversation helped me learn how to make my real intentions clearer to my colleague. Process conversations are also especially important in relationships that are largely or exclusively virtual. In. When contact is infrequent, it's essential to talk explicitly about how you will communicate. For example, how will you make sure that everyone has a turn to speak? How will you make space for people to pause and think? What tools will you use? What norms should we establish? How will you accommodate different time zones and work patterns to answer these questions, start by asking yourself, when do virtual conversations work well for me, and when do they not? Then consider the process. Remember, if you don't talk it out, you'll act it out, and virtual relationships leave much more room for acting it out. Choose. The next step in finding the right topic to discuss is to choose. Choosing is a matter of filtering all the issues you've teased apart through a single question, what do I really want? You'll see even more of the power of this question in the next chapter. Ponder what your highest priority is. Then choose the issue that stands between you and that objective. For example, if what you really want is to solve a customer problem, you may choose to deal with the content issue. How do we get this to Malaysia in two days, rather than the relationship I don't trust that you'll handle this right or pattern? Our fulfillment team frequently puts off doing things until they become crises you choose to return to the other conversations later simplify having made your choice, be sure you can state simply what you want to discuss. We're not talking about how you'll start the conversation.</p>
        <p>We mean narrow the problem down to a succinct statement. This is harder than it sounds. Try stopping people who are great during Crucial Conversations, right before they address a concern, we've done this ask them what's the issue you want to address? You'll find that they take far fewer words to say it than the rest of us. The more words it takes you to describe the topic, the less prepared you are to talk. For example, when we asked one skilled person what his message was in a forthcoming performance review, he said, I've concluded he is not good at managing people or projects. Boom, Crystal, clear, simple, he's ready. Why is this clarity so rare? Often, when we mortals take this step, we feel a sense of dread as we start to admit the real problem to ourselves. We panic about how we could possibly say it. It's less scary when we leave the problem vague, when you can slosh around an issue in a giant bowl of words. It's easy to water it down, but when you simply state the essence of what you need to address, you feel a jolting sense of accountability to do so you stare the size of the issue square in the face. But that shouldn't create panic. It should create resolution. Notice that the panic happens only when you conflate two problems, while part of your brain considers what's the real issue, another part shrieks, how in the world will I say that don't do this. If you worry about the how, while trying to be honest about the what, you'll be tempted to water down your message when that happens, I don't think you're capable of managing people or projects.</p>
        <p>Starts to sound like how do you think things went on the product launch? We mince words, dance around and sugar coat our way into the conversation. Creating a simple problem statement helps you both start with a clear purpose and hold yourself accountable. It gives you a standard by which to measure whether you told your full truth. Don't worry about how you'll say it, just tell yourself the truth about what you want to say. Having done that, you can address the next problem. How can I both tell the truth and strengthen the relationship? The next few chapters will help you address that challenge, but put that on the shelf for now. At this point, just worry about getting the what right tell yourself the truth. This can be tough, but self honesty is the precondition to honesty with others. Let's say, for example, you and your colleagues are talking about where to place a group of new interns in your company. In the middle of the discussion about one of the interns a peer volunteers, there's a lot of Asians in our data analysis team. Let's put him there. Yeah, you're suddenly seized by two competing feelings, rage and terror. You're offended because you think the comment is either stupid or racist or both, but you're scared because you can't imagine a way of addressing the issue without provoking a fight. You're tempted to simply stay in the content, offer other options for the intern, make an argument about why other areas would be better for him, all the while, the real concern is simmering inside you. What should you do to begin with?</p>
        <p>Tell yourself the truth, even if you don't know what to say in that moment, stop and clarify what is truly bothering you. Only then can you decide what the right next step is, having told yourself the truth you believe his comment is evidence of either subtle or egregious racism. You can then decide if when and how to have that conversation. A word of warning. Be alert to when the topic changes. Most of the crucial problems we face require us to address issues at the pattern, process or relationship level. Very rarely is a content issue keeping us stuck. You can think of it like a dandelion growing in the middle of your well manicured lawn. The content issue is that bright yellow flower it is blatant, apparent and easy to get rid of. You just pluck that dandelion head right off, and suddenly your lawn is once again an unrelenting expanse of greenness. But you know what happens next? The dandelion blooms again and probably multiplies at the same time. Why? Because you didn't address the roots. The pattern, process and relationship level issues in our lives are like those roots. Until we identify and address them, we will face the same content issues again and again, but beware, just because you know you need to have a pattern or relationship level conversation doesn't make it easy. Once you have chosen the level of the conversation, it is up to you to keep it there. More often than not, when you step up to a pattern or relationship level conversation with someone, the other person's tendency will be to seek safety in a content level conversation.</p>
        <p>For example, you've noticed over the last several months that the creative output of one of your designers seems to be a bit stale. He's hitting all his deadlines and producing the requested deliverables, but the quality and innovation just aren't where you want them to be. It's not a problem of any one specific design. Rather, when taken as a body of work, his recent output isn't up to the same standards as it used to be. You decide to step up to this pattern conversation, have a look. You say, here are the last five designs you produced, and here are the five before that. As I see it, those from the past six months aren't at the same level of creativity as your previous work. Technically, they're right on target, but creatively, they've lost some shine. I'm interested in how you see it. He quickly responds. I know my work on the Johnston project this week wasn't as good as it could have been. It was really confusing to know what the client wanted, and I was balancing a ton of other projects at the same time. Do you see what just happened there? You stepped up to a pattern conversation the last six months of designs, and he responded by talking about a content issue the very last design he did. Now at this point, it can be very easy to get sucked into that conversation. It's as easy as saying, Yes, I know there's a lot going on, but the Johnston project was really critical for us as a team. We need your best work, and just like that, you're holding a different conversation than the one you intended. You'll walk away feeling unresolved. Why? Because you held the wrong conversation.</p>
        <p>There's no mal intent here on the part of the graphic designer. He isn't purposely trying to steer you off course. He's just fallen into the trap we all fall into choosing recent over right or easy over hard. It's up to you to keep the conversation at the level you want it by saying I know there was a lot going on this week along with the Johnson project, I get that and I'm actually less concerned with the specifics of the Johnson project than I am with the pattern I'm seeing in your work over the last six months. I'm wondering if there's something bigger going on here that's keeping you from delivering your. Best work. Generally, you should choose the level at which you want to hold the conversation and keep it there. However, there is an exception, place, a bookmark. Clarity is crucial, but so is flexibility. Remember, this isn't a monolog. It should be a dialog. There are other people in this conversation, and they have their own wants and needs. In some crucial conversations, new issues will come up, and you need to balance focus on your goals with flexibility to meet their goals. Let's listen as Tyra talks to her co worker, Katie, about some data she needs. Tyra, I was expecting to get the raw data file for Project ascent yesterday, but I haven't seen it. Is the file ready? Katie, the system's down this morning. I am totally locked out. I swear. I don't know how we're supposed to do our jobs around here if they can't even keep the systems running. Right? Tyra, well, maybe, but was the system down yesterday, Katie, who died and left you in charge. Why are you all over me on this? We're friends.</p>
        <p>Can't you cut me a little slack? Tyra, we are friends and co workers, I'm not trying to hound you. I just need this report. Katie, I know. I know. Sorry, I guess I'm just a little uptight because I already had to deal with Mark today. And Ew, that guy just gives me the creeps. I can't handle the way his eyes crawl all over me. I'm just on edge, sorry. Well, that was a lot more than Tyra bargained for. She started to address what seemed like a pretty straightforward issue, the missing data file, and she got three issues right back. The system is down the Aren't we friends manipulation and most concerning an implication of harassment. What do you do when you start a conversation focused on one issue and new issues emerge, you have a choice to make. You can either stay focused on the original issue or move to a new one. In all cases you want to place a bookmark. When you place a bookmark, you verbally acknowledge where you're going in the conversation and what you intend to come back to. Let's say Tyra wants to move to this new issue. Her friend's experience with Mark. She moves to the new issue and bookmarks the original issue by saying, Wow. I can tell you're upset. Let's talk about this. We'll come back to the data file later. In some cases, although probably not this one, given the seriousness of the emergent issue, you may want to bookmark the new issue and stay focused on the original, wow, that's a big deal, and I really want to talk about what you're experiencing, because it needs to be addressed.</p>
        <p>At the same time, I have 30 minutes to get this data file over to the ops team. Let's figure out this data file issue, and then come back to Mark, because that needs to be addressed. When you place a bookmark, you make a conscious choice about what you want to talk about, and you register clearly with the other person that you will return to the bookmarked issue later. Never allow the conversation to shift or the topic to change without acknowledging you've done it back to Wendy. Remember Wendy, she was facing a pretty complex conversation with her manager. They started out talking about a project timeline. As the conversation progressed, new issues came into play, how decisions were being made, what input was being considered, and the pressure that Sandrine was putting on Wendy with veiled threats. Let's see how Wendy responded when Sandrine said, Look, I really pushed for you to be the one to lead this project. Do you know what I said about you? I said you were a team player. Was I mistaken? Wendy made the smart choice in this situation to bookmark the project, timeline, the content issue, and move the conversation to the relationship level. Her simple problem sentence was, this is about whether I can trust our process and trust you. She responded to Sandrine saying, I get we're in a tough spot here. I don't want to disappoint our leadership any more than you do, and I want you to know that I'm committed to getting stuff done at the same time. I want us to set realistic goals, otherwise we're setting ourselves up to fail. And maybe even more important, I want us to work together in a way.</p>
        <p>Today where we're up front with each other about our needs and concerns. This was the start of a relationship conversation and the start of a better relationship summary. Choose your topic. You can't solve the real problem if you don't choose the right topic. Here's how to make sure you're talking about the right thing. Learn the three signs you're having the wrong conversation. Number one, your emotions escalate. Number two, you walk away skeptical. Number three, your deja vu dialog. Use three skills to identify your topic and prepare to keep focused on it. Number one, unbundle, unpack the various issues at play using CPR. Are they content, pattern or relationship concerns or perhaps process. Number two, choose ask yourself, what do I really want? Use this as a filter to choose which topic is most relevant at the moment. Number three, simplify, condense your concern into a single sentence so you can maintain focus once the conversation gets underway. Finally, be both focused and flexible. Pay attention to others unintentional or intentional efforts to change the topic. Don't allow the topic to change without a conscious decision. And if you do decide to shift topics, bookmark the original one to make it easy to return to after the new topic is handled. You.</p>
