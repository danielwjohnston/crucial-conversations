        <p>Announcer, chapter four, start with heart. How to stay focused on what you really want speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. Ambrose Bierce, now that you know what you want to talk about, it's time to turn to the how of dialog. How do you encourage the flow of meaning when you're in the thrall of strong emotions, talking about things that matter deeply to you with those who disagree vehemently, given that most people's style is based on long standing habits, it'll probably require a lot of effort. The truth is, people can change. In fact, we've taught these conversation skills to millions around the world and have seen dramatic improvements in results and relationships. But it requires work. You can't simply highlight an inspiring paragraph in a book and walk away changed. Instead, you'll need to start by taking a long, hard look at yourself. That's why start with heart is the foundation of dialog. Change begins with your heart. Our bias is the opposite. Our bodies are designed to gather data about others, not ourselves. To paraphrase Shakespeare, the eye sees everything but itself. We can hear how others are overstating their points, we can see how they're clenching their fists and spraying spittle while they harangue us. What we fail to notice is our own eye roll, head shake and sneer. One of the most important lessons we've learned from those who do their best during crucial moments is that it all begins with me. The first thing that degenerates during a Crucial Conversation is not your behavior, it's your motive, and we can rarely see it happening. The first step to dialog is to get your heart right. Work on me.</p>
        <p>First US second, let's start with a true story. Two young sisters, Aislinn and Cara and their father scurry into their hotel room after spending a hot afternoon at Disneyland. Given the repressive heat, the girls have consumed enough soda to irrigate a small farm. As the two bursting kids enter their room, they have but one thought to head for the head, since the bathroom is a one holer, it isn't long until a fight breaks out. The desperate children start arguing, pushing and name calling as they dance around the tiny bathroom. Eventually, Aislinn calls out to her father for help, Dad, I got here first I know, but I need to go worse. Says, Kara, how do you know you're not in my body? I didn't even go before we left this morning. You're so selfish, dad, in a naive attempt to teach them to solve their own problems, proposes a plan. Girls, I'm not going to solve this for you. You can stay in the bathroom and figure out who goes first and who goes second. There's only one rule, no hitting as the two antsy kids begin their crucial conversation, Dad checks his watch, he wonders how long it will take. As the minutes slowly tick away, he hears nothing more than an occasional outburst of sarcasm. Finally, after 25 long minutes, the toilet flushes. Cara comes out. A minute later, another flush, and out walks Aislinn with both girls in the room. Dad asks, Do you know how many times both of you could have gone to the bathroom in the time it took you to work that out? The idea had not occurred to the little scamps. Dad then probes further.</p>
        <p>Why did it take so long for the two of you to use the bathroom? Because she's always so selfish. Listen to her. She's calling me names when she could have just waited. She always has to have her way. Both girls claimed what they wanted most was to go to the bathroom. Then they behaved in ways that ensured the bathroom was little more than a distant dream based on the 25 minute bathroom dance. What was their real motive to experience the blessed relief of using the toilet? No sometimes the best way to discern motive is to examine behavior. By looking at how the sisters were acting, we can see what they really wanted was to be first, to be right, or perhaps even to make the other sister miserable. The first problem we face in our Crucial Conversations is not that our behavior degenerates. It's that our motives do a shift that we are often completely unaware of. Instead, we cling to our stated motive and ignore what our behavior reveals about our true motive. The first step in achieving the results we really want is to stop believing that others are the source of all that ails us, our sister is not the problem. Our motives are. It's our dogmatic conviction that quote, if we could just fix those losers, all would go better. Close quote that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialog and progress. It's no surprise, then that those who are best at dialog. Tend to turn this logic around. They believe the best way to work on us is to start with me. People who are best at dialog understand this simple fact and turn it into the principle, work on me.</p>
        <p>First a second, they realize not only that they are likely to benefit by improving their own approach, but also that the only ones they can work on anyway are themselves, as much as others may need to change, or we may want them to change. The only person we can continually inspire, prod and shape with any degree of success is the person in the mirror. Start with heart. Okay, so let's assume we need to work on our own personal dialog skills. Instead of buying this audio book and transcribing all the key parts that you know will address the weaknesses of a loved one or co worker and saying you're going to love this, especially these parts that I've transcribed for you, we'll try to figure out how we ourselves can benefit. But where do we start? Skilled people start with heart, that is, they begin high risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused on those motives no matter what happens. They maintain this focus in two ways. First, they're steely eyed, smart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite constant impulses to slip away from their goals, they stick with them. Second, skilled people don't make fools choices. Unlike others, who justify their unhealthy behavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or take flight, the dialog smart believe that dialog, no matter the circumstances, is always an option, a moment of truth. Let's look at a real life example of how losing sight of our motives can affect our ability to stay in dialog. Greta, the CEO of a mid sized Corporation, is two hours into a rather tense meeting with her top leaders.</p>
        <p>For the past six months, she has been on a personal campaign to reduce costs. Little has been accomplished to date, so Greta calls the meeting. Surely people will tell her why they haven't started cutting costs. After all, she's taken great pains to foster candor. Grete has just opened the meeting to questions when a manager haltingly rises to his feet, fidgets, stares at the floor, and then nervously asks if he can ask a very tough question the way the fellow emphasizes the word very makes it sound as if he's about to accuse Greta of perpetrating 911 the frightened manager continues, Greta, you've been asking us for six months to find ways to cut costs. I'd be lying if I said that. We've given you much more than a lukewarm response. If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you about one thing that's making it tough for us to take this seriously great fire away. Greta says, as she smiles in response, this is exactly what she wants to hear, what the barriers are so she can address them and let the cost cutting begin. Well, while you've been asking us to use both sides of our paper and forgo travel, you're having a second office built. Greta freezes and turns bright red. Everyone looks to see what will happen next. The manager plunges on ahead. The rumor is that the furniture alone will cost hundreds of 1000s of dollars. Is that right? The conversation has just turned crucial. Someone has just poured a radioactive liquid into the pool of meaning.</p>
        <p>Will Greta continue to encourage honest feedback, or will she shut the fellow down how Greta acts during the next few moments, not only will set people's attitude toward the proposed cost cutting initiative, but will also have a huge impact on what the other leaders think about her. Does she walk the talk of openness and honesty, or is she a raging hypocrite, like so many of the senior executives who came before her, what is she acting like she wants? As we watch Greta, something quite subtle and yet very important takes place. Greta's jaw tightens. She leans forward and grips the left side of the rostrum hard enough that her knuckles turn white, she lifts her right hand with the finger pointing at the questioner like a loaded weapon. She hasn't said anything yet, but it is clear where Greta is heading. She has been attacked publicly, and she is preparing to defend herself in less time than it takes her to clear her thoughts, her motive has changed from succeeding with cost cutting to something less noble. What Greta cares most about right now is not getting results, but getting revenge. She isn't worried about how the company performs. She's worried about how she appears when under attack, our hearts can take a similarly sudden and unconscious turn when faced with pressure and strong opinions, we often stop worrying about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning and start looking for ways to win, save face, keep the peace, or punish others. Just ask Grete to heck with honest communication. She thinks to herself, I'll teach the moron not to attack me in public. Is that a sin? Serious question she wants to ask.</p>
        <p>She wants to say, if we want to win bigger customers, we need a facility that shows some self confidence. If you had an executive mindset, you'd understand this next question. At the sight of her pointing her finger, everyone immediately clammed up and looked at the floor. The silence was deafening for a moment as everyone waited for what came next, first focus on what you really want, then Grete did something remarkable. Almost as soon as her finger rose like a loaded pistol, it dropped back to her side, her face relaxed. At first. She looked surprised, embarrassed and maybe even a little upset, but then she took a deep breath and said, You know what? We need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. Thank you for taking that risk. I appreciate the trust it shows in me. Wow. In a matter of seconds, she had transformed from a dangerous weapon into a curious partner. And then Greta got real. She acknowledged the apparent hypocrisy in talking cost cutting while spending on a new office. She admitted that she did not know what the project would cost, and asked someone to leave the meeting to check the numbers. She explained that building the office was a response to marketing's advice to boost the company's image and improve client confidence, and while Greta would use the office, it would be primarily a hosting location for marketing. But she added, I have not managed this project as tightly as I'm asking you to manage yours, and that's hypocritical. When she saw the figures for the office, Greta was stunned and admitted that she should have checked the costs before signing a work order.</p>
        <p>A wonderfully candid exchange followed wherein various participants in the meeting expressed their views about the propriety of the project. In the end, they agreed to move ahead but cut the costs by half or cancel the project entirely. Widespread support for cost cutting took off from that moment. As we watched this interaction, we wondered what had happened to Greta. How did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback later that day, we asked Greta about the transformation. We wanted to know exactly what had been going on in her head, what had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude. It was easy. Greta explained, at first, I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong. But she continued, I've learned that when my emotions take over, the best way to get back into control is to focus on a simple question. At this point, she had our full attention. Could asking yourself a single question truly transform your emotions the way we had witnessed it happening for Greta, and if so, what question should you ask? She continued, when I feel threatened, I pause, take a breath and ask, what do I really want? Really we asked, and how did that help? The first answer that came up for me was, I want to humiliate this guy who was attacking me. That was my emotions talking. So I pressed again, what do I really want?</p>
        <p>And that's when the clarity came, what I really want is for 200 managers to leave here supportive of cost cutting Greta went on. When that commitment settled inside me, it transformed the way I saw the man in the back of the room, whereas seconds earlier, he looked like an enemy. When my motive changed, I could see that he was the best ally I had in the room. He was the one handing me the best chance I had of dealing with the resistance I was facing. It was easy then to respond in the right way. Suddenly, Greta s rapid transformation from tyrant to Leader made sense when her motive changed from saving face to solving a problem. It was perfectly natural for her words to be. You know what? We need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. Thank you for taking that risk. Greta taught us that a small mental intervention, the simple act of asking a potent question, can have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts, refocus your brain. Now let's move to a situation you might face. You're speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all this motive stuff apply as you begin the discussion? Start by examining your motives. Going in. Ask yourself what you really want. As the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to say, defer to the boss or give your partner the cold shoulder, pay attention to what's happening to your objectives. Are you starting to worry more about saving face, avoiding embarrassment, winning, being right, or punishing others? Here's the tricky part, our motive.</p>
        <p>Is usually changed without any conscious thought on our part, when adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow with the chemical tide. In a sense, you don't choose the motive. It chooses you, but if you can see it, you can change it. The first step to getting back to a healthy motive is to become aware of the one that's possessing you. This is harder than it might seem in our adrenaline drunk, dumbed down state, we're often not very skillful at subtle self awareness. So what's a human to do? Look for clues, discern your motives from the outside in in order to move back to motives that allow for dialog, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourself much like an outsider would ask yourself, What am I acting like? I want take a look at your behavior and work backward to the motive as you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude, let's see, I'm cutting people off, overstating my points and shaking my head every time they talk, aha, I've shifted from planning a great vacation to winning an argument. Once you humbly acknowledge the shifting desires of your heart, you can make conscious choices to change them. The fastest way to free yourself of a hurtful motive is to simply admit you've got it. When you name the game, you can stop playing it. Now ask, what do I really want? Ask yourself these three questions, what do I really want for myself? What do I really want for others? What do I really want for the relationship? Once you're free of the lower motive, healthy answers will come quickly and easily.</p>
        <p>What I really want is for us to all feel great about the vacation spot we choose once you've asked yourself what you want add one more equally telling question, what should I do right now to move toward what I really want Taken together, these four questions are a powerful tool for refocusing your brain. Here's how play the long game. These questions form powerful emotional interventions when we need it most. You can't rush through them. If you do, you'll end up answering them insincerely and with a short term focus. You may have to ask them each several times before you can dig down deep enough to reconnect with a long term motive. Years ago, we watched this play out with a young brother and sister who were racing across a grassy field when they got to the edge of the field, the sister turned to her brother and triumphantly cried, I win. I win. Then after no more than a heartbeat, added, you lose. You lose. What did she want for herself in that moment to win? What did she want for her brother to lose? When we are caught in the passion of the moment and our motives have shifted, we become myopic, focusing on what we really want right now to move out of that near term focus, you may need to ask yourself these questions more than once. You may also find it helpful to add long term to the questions. Asking, what do I really want for myself in the long term helps us shift our focus from our immediate, near term desires to a more profound consideration of who we want to be. What kind of person do I want to be? How do I want to treat others?</p>
        <p>How do I need to show up in this conversation to be that kind of person? Re engage your brain. These questions are also a powerful tool for re engaging your brain. The reason they are so potent is that they help massage the higher reasoning centers of your brain back into activity, calming the fight or flight instinct. It works this way. When you pose complex and abstract questions to yourself, the problem solving part of your brain recognizes that you are now dealing with intricate social issues and not physical threats. When we present our brain with a demanding question, our body sends blood to the parts of our brain that help us think and away from the parts of our body that help us take flight or begin a fight refuse the fool's choice. Now let's add one more tool that helps us focus on what we really want. We'll start with a story. Talley is scrolling through her social media feed when she stumbles on a passionate debate about a proposed curriculum change for her kids school. Wanting to be an informed parent, she carefully reads the lengthy post and the numerous comments that follow. The discussion is robust, and parents, both for and against the proposed changes, are making reasonable arguments. Talley finds herself agreeing with people on both sides of the argument. Then Gloria, who lives in the building across the street, starts to weigh in. GLORIA expresses her loathing for the proposed changes with strong language and all caps. She knows without a shadow of a doubt that these curriculum changes will ruin all the neighborhood kids, all of whom will end up dropping out of school and selling drugs as a result. Predictably, people begin to push back on Gloria.</p>
        <p>Gloria responds by pushing back on the push back. Soon, the debate is no longer about curriculum. It's about the idiots who dare to think differently than she does. As tally reads on, she feels her blood start to boil. These are her neighbors and friends that Gloria is attacking. This isn't right. Someone needs to put Gloria in her place and stop these vicious posts. Talleys fingers fly as she taps out a response to Gloria's latest post at Gloria, you are the one who is an idiot. Principal Johnston has turned this school around. If she says this curriculum is the way to help our kids, then it is you have no qualifications or standing here, you didn't even graduate from high school. You're a big phony when it comes to education, and I'm not going to stand by and let you attack people who are actually qualified to discuss the education of our children. Talley stabs her finger at the screen posting her message with a feeling of righteousness, someone had to stand up to Gloria Within moments, Tally hears the ding of an incoming direct message. It's from another neighbor, Miguel, whoa. Tally. That was a little harsh. Don't you think? Then another from Sandra and Karen and Tyrone. It's clear that tallys fellow parents are taken aback by her take down of Gloria, Talia utters and then messages the words we've all come to hate. Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm the only one around here who has the guts to speak the truth. What a tactic. Tally attacks Gloria in public, and then instead of apologizing or maybe simply fading into the shadows, she argues that what she just did was somehow noble. She's made the fool's choice.</p>
        <p>Her statement assumes she had to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend. Those who are skilled at Crucial Conversations present their brains with a more complex question they ask, What do I want for myself, the other person and the relationship. As you practice presenting this question to yourself at emotional times, you'll discover that at first, you resist it. When our brain isn't functioning well, we resist complexity. It seems well, complex. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking or hiding, and the fact that we think it makes us look good, I'm sorry, but I just had to destroy her self image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasn't pretty, but it was the right thing to do. Fortunately, when you refuse the fool's choice and instead require your brain to solve the more complex problem, more often than not, your brain does just that, you'll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationship all at the same time. And the results can be life changing. Search for the elusive and the best at dialog refuse fools choices by setting up new choices, they present themselves with tougher questions that turn the either or choice into a search for the all important and ever elusive. And it is an endangered species. You know, here's how this works. First, clarify what you really want. You've got a head start. If you've already started with heart, if you know what you want for yourself, for others and for the relationship, then you're in a position to break out of the fool's choice. What I want is to engage in community discussion about a curriculum that impacts all our kids.</p>
        <p>I want our group of parents to be able to share candidly and listen to one another second clarify what you really don't want. This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard or if you don't try to escape what horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? What I don't want is to have people shut down because one person is dominating the discussion thread and throwing insults. I also don't want our honest difference to lead to damaged relationships. Third, present your brain with a more complex problem. Finally, combine the two into an and question that forces you to search for more creative and productive options than silence or violence. How can we have a candid conversation and strengthen our relationships? It's interesting to watch what happens when people are presented with and questions after being stuck with fools choices, their faces become reflective, their eyes open wider, and they begin to think with surprising regularity. When people are asked, Is it possible that there's a way to accomplish both? They acknowledge that there very well may be. Is there a way to tell your peer your real concerns and not insult or offend him? Is there a way to talk to your neighbors about their annoying behavior? And not come across as self righteous or demanding. Is there a way to talk with your loved one about how you're spending money and not get into an argument? Is this really possible?</p>
        <p>Some people believe that this whole line of thinking is comically unrealistic from their point of view, fools choices aren't false dichotomies. They're merely a reflection of an unfortunate reality. For example, you can't say something to the boss about our upcoming move. It'll cost your job. To these people, we say, Remember Kevin, he and almost every other opinion leader we've ever studied has what it takes to speak up and maintain respect. Maybe you don't know what Kevin did or what you need to do, but don't deny the existence of Kevin or people like him. There is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship. When we the authors, are in the middle of an on site workshop and we suggest there are alternatives to fools choices, someone invariably says, maybe you can speak honestly and still be heard in other organizations, but if you try it here, you'll be eaten alive. Or the flip side, you've got to know when to fold if you want to survive for another day. At first we thought that maybe there were places where dialog couldn't survive, but then we learned to ask, are you saying there isn't anyone you know who is able to hold a high risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships. There usually is summary, start with heart. Here's how people who are skilled at dialog stay focused on their goals, particularly when the going gets tough. Work on me, first US second. Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself. Focus on what you really want. When you find yourself moving towards silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself, What am I acting like I want? Then clarify what you really want. Ask yourself, what do I really want for myself, for others, for the relationship? And finally, ask, What should I do right now to move toward what I really want, refuse the fool's choice. As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a fool's choice. Break free of these fool's choices by searching for the and clarify what you don't want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialog. Chapter Five, Master my stories, how to stay in dialog when you're angry, scared or hurt. It's not how you play the game. It's how the game plays. You spy game. Here's where we are in our Crucial Conversation. We've recognized the conversation might be crucial chapters one and two. We've even zeroed in on the right conversation to address chapter three. We've thought about what we really want. Chapter Four, we're almost ready to open our mouths, but not quite yet. We still have one problem to solve. We don't feel like engaging in dialog. What we feel like doing would forever eliminate the chance to run for public office, as we learned in chapter two, one of the defining features of Crucial Conversations is strong emotions. Without these emotions, most of us do just fine in a conversation. We can talk about the weather like a champ, but when our emotions come into play, we often become the very worst version of ourselves, and the conversation nosedives. This chapter explores how to gain control of crucial conversations by learning how to take charge of your emotions.</p>
        <p>How you respond to your own emotions is the best predictor of everything that matters in life. It is the very essence of emotional intelligence. By learning to exert influence over your own feelings, you'll place yourself in a far better position to use all the tools of crucial conversations. He made me mad. How many times have you heard someone say he made me mad? How many times have you said it? For instance, you're sitting quietly at home watching TV, and your mother in law, who lives with you, walks in, she glances around and then starts picking up the mess you made a few minutes earlier when you whipped up a batch of nachos, this ticks you off. She's always smugly skulking around the house thinking you're a slob. A few minutes later, when your spouse asks why you're so upset, you explain, it's your mom again, I was lying here enjoying myself when she gave me that. Look, to be honest, I wish she would quit doing that. It's my only day off. I'm relaxing quietly, and then she walks in and starts judging me. It drives me nuts. Does she drive you nuts? Your spouse asks, or do you that's an interesting question. No matter who is doing the driving? Some people tend to react more explosively than others and to the same stimulus, no less. Why is that? For instance, what enables some people to listen to withering feedback without flinching, whereas others pitch a fit when you tell them they've got a smear of salsa on their chin.</p>
        <p>Why is it that sometimes you yourself can take a verbal blow to the gut without batting an eye, but other times you go ballistic if someone so much as looks at you sideways, emotions don't just happen. To answer these questions, we'll start with two rather bold and sometimes unpopular claims. Then we'll explain the logic behind each claim. Claim one emotions don't settle upon you like a fog. They are not foisted upon you by others. No matter how comfortable it might make you feel to say it, others don't make you mad. You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, insulted or hurt you, and only you create your emotions. Claim two. Once you've created your upset emotions, you have only two options. You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here's how this all unfolds. Maria's story. Consider Maria a copywriter who is currently being held hostage to some pretty strong emotions. She and her colleague Louis just reviewed the latest draft of a proposal with their boss. During the meeting. They were supposed to be jointly presenting their ideas, but when Maria paused to take a breath, Louis took over the presentation, making almost all the points they had come up with together. When the boss turned to Maria for input, there was nothing left for her to say. Maria has been feeling humiliated and angry throughout this project. First, Louis took their suggestions to the boss and discussed them behind her back, and now he completely monopolized the presentation. Maria believes Louis is downplaying her contribution because she's the only woman on the team.</p>
        <p>She's getting fed up with his boys club mentality. So what does she do? She doesn't want to appear over sensitive, so most of the time, she says nothing and just does her job. However, she does manage to assert herself by occasionally getting in sarcastic jabs about the way she's being treated. Sure I can get that print out for you. Should I just get your coffee and whip up a bundt cake while I'm at it? She mutters and she rolls her eyes as she exits the room. Louis, in turn, finds Maria's cheap shots in sarcasm, puzzling. He's not sure what has Maria upset, but is beginning to resent her hostile reaction to almost everything he does. As a result, when the two work together, you could cut the tension with a knife. What's making Maria and Louis mad? The worst at dialog fall into the trap Maria has fallen into. Maria is completely unaware of a dangerous assumption she's making. She's upset at being overlooked and is keeping a professional silence. She's assuming that her emotions and behavior are the only right and reasonable reactions under the circumstances, she's convinced that anyone in her place would feel the same way. Here's the problem, Maria is treating her emotions as if they are the only valid response, since in her mind, they are both justified and accurate. She makes no effort to change or even question them, besides, in her view, Louis caused them. Ultimately, her actions, saying nothing and taking cheap shots, are being driven by these very emotions. Her emotions are controlling her behavior and fueling her deteriorating relationship with Lewis, the worst at dialog fall hostage to their emotions and they don't even know it.</p>
        <p>The good at dialog realize that if they don't control their emotions, matters will get worse. So they try something else. They fake it, they take a deep breath and count to 10. They choke down. Own reactions, and then do their best to get back to dialog, at least they give it a shot. Unfortunately, once these emotionally choked folks hit a rough spot in a crucial conversation, their suppressed emotions come out of hiding. These suppressed emotions show up as tightened JAWS or sarcastic comments, dialog dies, or maybe people's paralyzing fear causes them to avoid saying what they really think meaning is kept out of the pool because it's cut off at the source. In any case, their emotions sneak out of the cubby hole they've been crammed into and find a way to creep into the conversation. It's never pretty, and it always kills dialog. The best at dialog do something completely different. They aren't held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong feelings, they influence and often change their emotions by thinking them out as a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results. This, of course, is easier said than done. It's not easy to rethink yourself from an emotional and dangerous state into one that puts you back in control, but it can be done. It should be done. The path to action to help rethink our emotions, we need to know where our feelings come from in the first place. Let's look at a model that helps us examine and then gain control of our own emotions. Consider Maria.</p>
        <p>She's feeling hurt, but is worried that if she says something to Louis, she'll look too emotional. So she alternates between holding her feelings inside and taking cheap shots. Maria's actions stem from her feelings. First she feels, and then she acts. That's easy enough, but it prompts the question, what's causing Maria's feelings in the first place? Is it Lewis's behavior, as was the case with the nacho mother in law incident, did Lewis make Maria feel insulted and hurt? Maria heard and saw Lewis jump in and deliver several key points in their presentation that she was planning to cover based on what she saw and heard, she generated an emotion, and then she acted out her feelings. So here's the big question, what happens between what Maria sees and hears ie Lewis acting and what she feels? Does what we see, hear or experience make us feel something, and if so, why do different people feel differently under the same circumstances, stories create feelings. As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel. Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it. We tell ourselves a story. We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior. Why were they doing that? We also add judgment. Is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with an emotion. This intermediate step is why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, 10 people may have 10 different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted, whereas others merely feel curious, some become angry, and others feel concern or even sympathy.</p>
        <p>You'll note that we've added telling a story to our model. We observe. We tell a story, and then we feel, although this edition complicates the model a bit, it also gives us hope, since we and only we are telling the story, we can take back control of our own emotions by telling a different story. We now have a point of leverage or control if we can find a way to change the stories we tell by rethinking or retelling them, we can master our emotions and therefore master our Crucial Conversations, our stories. Nothing in this world is good or bad, but thinking makes it so. William Shakespeare, stories provide a rationale for what's going on. There are interpretations. Version of the facts. They start by helping to explain what we see and hear. Carl is walking out of the building with a bright yellow box. Yellow boxes contain secure material, but usually stories take the what a step further and give voice to why something is happening. Carl is stealing our intellectual property. Our stories contain not just conclusions, but also judgments, whether something is good or bad, and attributions, interpretations of others, motives. Think about Maria and Lewis. Maria observes that Lewis has started talking and now won't stop what is happening here. Maria concludes that Lewis is taking over the presentation. But Maria's story doesn't stop there. She quickly tells herself a story about why Louis is taking over the presentation. He doesn't trust my ability to communicate. He thinks they're more likely to listen to a man and he's trying to hog the spotlight for himself.</p>
        <p>She begins to attribute motive to Lewis's actions, and then she makes a judgment he's a sexist, power hungry weasel, of course, as we come up with our own meaning or stories, it isn't long until our body responds with strong feelings or emotions. After all, our emotions are directly linked to our judgments of right and wrong, good and bad, kind and selfish, fair and unfair, etc. Maria's story yields anger and frustration. These feelings, in turn drive Maria to her actions, toggling back and forth between clamming up and taking an occasional cheap shot. A few facts about stories, even if you don't realize it, you are telling yourself stories when we teach people that it's our stories that drive our emotions and not other people's actions. Someone inevitably raises a hand and says, Wait a minute. I didn't notice myself telling a story. When that guy laughed at me during my presentation, I just felt angry. The feelings came first. The thoughts came second. Storytelling typically happens blindingly fast when we believe we're at risk, we tell ourselves a story so quickly that we don't even know we're doing it. If you don't believe this is true, ask yourself whether you always become angry when someone laughs at you. If sometimes you do and sometimes you don't, then your response isn't hardwired. That means that something goes on between others laughing and you feeling in truth. You tell a story. You may not remember it, but you tell a story. Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories. Stories are just that stories. These explanations could be told in numerous different ways.</p>
        <p>For instance, Maria could just as easily have decided that Louis didn't realize she cared so much about the project. She could have concluded that Lewis was feeling unimportant, and this was a way of showing he was valuable, or maybe he had been burned in the past because he hadn't personally seen through every detail of a project. Any of these stories would have fit the facts and would have created very different emotions. If we take control of our stories, they won't control us. People who excel at dialog are able to influence their emotions during Crucial Conversations. They recognize that while it's true that at first, we are in control of the stories we tell, once they're told, the stories control us, they first control how we feel and then how we act, and thus they control the results we get from our Crucial Conversations. The good news is we can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop. If you want improved results from your Crucial Conversations, change the stories you tell yourself, even while you're in the middle of the fray. Why master our stories? We're about to share some very effective tools you can use to expose, examine and improve your story. We confess up front that these skills take work. They take focus, concentration and humility. Many people make it halfway through this section and shout out something akin to, why do I have to do all this bleeping work? Translated, they're asking, why not live in the simple life of blaming others for causing our emotions? Yes, the truth is, you don't have to do this work unless you want different results. If you want different results, you'll need different emotions.</p>
        <p>If Maria wants to get different results and have a different working relationship with Lewis, she is going to have to act in different ways in order to act differently, she'll need to feel differently. In order to feel differently, she must master her story. Mastering our stories isn't about letting someone off the hook for bad behavior. Instead, it is the first step toward addressing that behavior through dialog. When we master our stories, we take ownership for the emotional energy we bring to the conversation, and when we do that, we begin to change the conversation. Another reason it's risky to leave your story unexamined is that your story might be creating your reality. Most often, when people defend their story, they are saying that their story is an accurate reflection of reality. The reality came first, and their story merely captured it, maybe. But when you dig deeper, it is not uncommon to find that the story itself created the reality, or at least contributed to it. We call this a downward spiral. Here's a real life example of how it works. It happened to Joseph early in his marriage. He describes it this way, I'd been married for just a few years. A couple of children had come along, and my travel schedule was starting to become hectic. Sila, my wife, agreed to be the sole parent. When I was gone, I came home from a trip one evening, Sela was sitting on the couch reading. I was about to say hello, when the phone rang, I had two immediate thoughts. One, answer the phone. It could be an international emergency that only I can solve. Two, don't answer the phone. The love of my life would like time with me.</p>
        <p>I had a clear feeling about what I should do, but I violated it. I picked up the phone. It was one of my business partners, and I began a conversation. Now stay with me here, because you may doubt me for just a moment. At that moment, I felt a burning sensation in the middle of my back, a hot feeling that radiated outward. I looked around to find the source of it, and there was sila across the room staring a hole in the middle of my back. She wore a terrifying angry glare. I looked at her, rolled my eyes resentfully and turned away. I heard her book slam shut and she stomped out of the room. I looked over at her as she passed and shook my head condescendingly. How was that for handling a crucial conversation I could not have done worse. Can you see the irony in Joseph's story when he came home after a long week of travel, guess what he wanted most time with the love of his life, and when he walked into the house, guess what sila wanted most time with the love of her life? And yet, both behaved in ways that got them the opposite. Why? Because both were hostage to their stories. In that moment, both believed their stories were accurate and neither realized that their stories were creating their reality. For example, when Joseph felt the burning sensation and observed Silas expression, he told himself that Selah was unappreciative. She was judgmental. She was trying to control him in his story, he justified answering the phone by thinking, I've been working hard all week, and this is the treatment I get. As a result, he felt defensive and resentful.</p>
        <p>That led to his ill fated eye roll. The result, sila closes her book loudly and leaves the room. In this moment, Joseph would argue his story is true, Selah is judging me, and she is being unappreciative while there might be truth to Joseph's claim, what he's missing is the fact that he is part of the story. His actions helped sila to tell the kind of story that created upset emotions that led to her behavior. He was a full partner in the downward spiral. Be careful when you argue for your story that you first examine whether you might be creating the reality you claim to describe. So why master your stories? Because it's a necessary step on the path toward what you really want. Skills from mastering our stories. What's the most effective way to come up with different stories? The best at dialog, find a way to first slow down and then take charge of their path to action. Here's. How retrace your path to slow down the lightning quick storytelling process and the subsequent flow of adrenaline, retrace your path to action one element at a time. This calls for a bit of mental gymnastics. First, you have to stop what you're currently doing. Then you have to get in touch with why you're doing it. Here's how to retrace your path. Act, notice your behavior. Ask, am I acting out my concerns rather than talking them out? Feel, put your feelings into words. Ask, what emotions are encouraging me to act this way. Tell story. Analyze your stories. Ask, what story is creating these emotions, see and hear. Get back to the facts. Ask, what have I seen or heard that supports this story?</p>
        <p>What have I seen or heard that conflicts with this story. By retracing your path one element at a time, you put yourself in a position to think about question and change any or all of the elements notice your behavior. Why would you stop and retrace your path to action in the first place? Certainly, if you're constantly stopping what you're doing and looking for your underlying motives and thoughts, you won't even be able to put on your shoes without thinking about it for. Who knows how long you'll die of analysis paralysis. Instead, consider two situations that can be cues to you that it's time to take a pause and retrace your path to action. Number one, bad results. You're not happy with the results you are getting. You're in a situation and you don't like the outcome. You'd like to be promoted, but it's not happening. You'd like to enjoy time with your family, but every time you're at extended family gatherings, tempers flare, whatever the situation, if you are not happy with the outcome, start by looking at how you behaved and the path to action that led to your behavior. Number two, tough emotions, you're feeling negative emotions, strong ones. This is one of the best cues that it is time to retrace your path if you're angry, frustrated, hurt, upset or irritated, this is a great cue to ask, Why? Why am I feeling this way? And how is this feeling causing me to act? But looking isn't enough. You must take an honest look at what you're doing. If you tell yourself a story that your aggressive behavior is a necessary tactic, you won't see the need to reconsider your actions.</p>
        <p>If you immediately jump in with they started it, or otherwise find yourself rationalizing your behavior, you also won't feel compelled to change rather than stop and review what you're doing, you'll tell self justifying stories to yourself and others. When an unhelpful story is driving your behavior, stop and consider how others would see your actions. For example, if the scene was live streamed on social media, how would you look? How would a disinterested third party describe your behavior? Not only do those who are best at Crucial Conversations notice when they're slipping out of dialog, but they're also able to admit it. They Don't wallow in self doubt, but they do admit the problem and begin to take corrective action the moment they realize they're killing dialog, they review their own path to action. Put your feelings into words. As skilled individuals retrace their own path to action, they move from admitting their own unhealthy behavior to verbalizing their emotions. At first glance, this task sounds easy. I'm angry. You think to yourself, What could be easier? Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they're feeling, they use words such as bad or angry or scared, which would be okay if these were accurate descriptors. But often they're not. Individuals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise, or they suggest they're unhappy when they're feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they're upset when they're really feeling humiliated and hurt. Since life doesn't consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make, but words do matter.</p>
        <p>Knowing what you're really feeling helps you to take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. Me, for instance, you're far more likely to take an honest look at the story you're telling yourself. If you admit you're feeling both embarrassed and surprised, rather than simply angry, when you take the time to precisely articulate what you're feeling, you begin to put a little bit of daylight between you and the emotion. This distance lets you move from being hostage to the emotion to being an observer of it. When you can hold it at a little distance from yourself, you can examine it, study it, and begin to change it, but that process can't begin until you name it. How about you when experiencing strong emotions, do you stop and think about what you're feeling if so, do you use a rich vocabulary, or do you draw mostly from terms such as, okay, bummed out, ticked off or frustrated? Second, do you talk openly with others about how you feel? Do you willingly talk with loved ones about what's going on inside you. Third, in doing so, do you take the time to get below the easy to say emotions and accurately identify those that take more vulnerability to acknowledge like shame, hurt, fear and inadequacy? It's important to get in touch with your feelings, and to do so, you may want to expand your emotional vocabulary, analyze your stories, question your feelings and stories. Once you've identified what you're feeling, stop and ask if, given the circumstances, it's the right feeling. Meaning, of course, are you telling the right story, the first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you're feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>This may be the hardest step, but it's also the most important one. By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions very real and the story behind them only one of many possible explanations are accurate. At this point, something overpowering inside us. Often protests, wait just a minute here. I shouldn't have to change my story. My story is accurate. It's true. I'm right. This is the emotional equivalent of a fool's choice. It argues that stories are either right or wrong. That's rarely the case. More often than not, our stories are more or less accurate. For example, Maria might be right that Lewis holds sexist biases about the influence of women, but that might not be all that's going on in the episode. What if Lewis just got a bad performance review in which his boss admonished him to have more of a voice. Would Maria feel differently if she knew this was also a part of what's happening? Furthermore, there are often subtleties embedded even in our accurate stories. For example, Maria's story could say that Lewis's sexism is an unforgivable offense, or that it's a changeable human failing, that small distinction could lead her to either condemn him or attempt to influence him, as we said, before any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories, the more we accept responsibilities for The stories we tell, the more nuanced and effective our emotional responses become. Get back to the facts. Sometimes you fail to question your stories because you see them as immutable facts.</p>
        <p>When you generate stories in the blink of an eye, you can get so caught up in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. They feel like facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with still hard data points. For example, in trying to ferret out facts from story, Maria might say he's a misogynistic jerk. That's a fact. Ask anyone who has seen how he treats me he's a misogynistic jerk. Is not a fact. It's the story that Maria created to give meaning to the facts. The facts could mean just about anything, as we said earlier, others could watch Maria's interactions with Lewis and walk away with different stories. The best way to liberate yourself from an overpowering story is to separate facts from story. When trying to strip out our story, it helps to test your ideas against a simple criterion. Can you see or hear this thing you're calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior? For example, it is a fact. That Lewis gave 95% of the presentation and answered all but one question. This is specific, objective and verifiable. Any two people watching the meeting would make the same observation. However, the statement he doesn't trust me is a conclusion. It explains what you think not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective. You.</p>
